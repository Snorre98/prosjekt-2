## Components

We have used [MUI](https://mui.com) to create some of the more complex components such as the navbar. For simple components, or components where we want to be more in control we make our own using just tsx and css.

## Global state management

We have chosen Redux for our global state management. We have not yet put it to use, but we will in the future.
