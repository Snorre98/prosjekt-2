        "bio_summary": "Abel Makkonen Tesfaye, popularly known as The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada), is a Canadian R&B/hip-hop musician, singer-songwriter and record producer. He chose his stage name in tribute to when he was 17 years old, when, along with his friend La Mar Taylor, he dropped out of high school, took his mattress, and \"left one weekend and never came home\". However, his estranged former producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Weeknd\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

On 1989, titled after her birth year to signify her symbolic artistic rebirth, Swift enlisted Max Martin as co-executive producer.\n\nThe album's synth-pop sound is characterized by heavy synthesizers, programmed drums and processed backing vocals. The songs, expanding on Swift's songwriting practice taking inspiration from her personal life, express lighthearted perspectives towards failed relationships, departing from her previous hostile attitude. Swift and Big Machine promoted the album extensively through product endorsements, television, radio appearances and social media. They pulled 1989 from free streaming services such as Spotify, prompting an industry discourse on the impact of streaming on music sales.\n\nAfter the album's release, Swift embarked on the 1989 World Tour, which was the highest-grossing tour of 2015. The album was supported by seven singles, including three US Billboard Hot 100 number ones: \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\" and \"Bad Blood\". Critics generally praised 1989 for its emotion and melodies, but a few were concerned over the synth-pop production, as they felt it eroded Swift's authenticity as a songwriter due to pop music's capitalist nature—a criticism that has been retrospectively described as rockist. Various publications listed 1989 as one of the best albums of the 2010s decade, with Rolling Stone and Consequence ranking it amongst the best of all time.\n\nAt the 58th Grammy Awards in 2016, 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first female solo artist to win Album of the Year twice. Retrospective commentaries regard 1989 as a key success in transforming Swift's image to that of a pop icon, promoting poptimism, but also highlighted how her artistic integrity and public image suffered from increasing media scrutiny. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Swift/1989\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In June 2019, Drake once again teased his progress on the album via Instagram, where the caption read:\n\n\"Album mode\nIn September 2019, multiple publications reported that Drake had finished his album, claiming that the album was set to release in November 2019. These rumors were later proved to be inaccurate.\"\n\nOn December 10, 2019, Drake made a guest appearance at DaBaby’s concert in Toronto, where he revealed that he was working on the album:\n\n\"I’ma go back to the crib and try to finish this album up so we can turn up in 2020.\"\n\nOn May 1, 2020, Drake dropped his fifth solo mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes as a precursor to his sixth album.

West incorporated layered synthesizers and dabbled with electronics while sampling from various music genres and altering his approach to rapping. He conveys an ambivalent outlook on his newfound fame and media scrutiny alongside providing inspirational messages of triumph directed at listeners. The album prematurely concludes the education theme of West's first two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005), as his aborted \"Good Ass Job\" album would have concluded the concept album's themes as a tetralogy instead of a trilogy as it ended up being.\n\nRecording sessions took place between 2005 and 2007 at several studios in New York and Los Angeles. It was primarily produced by West himself, with contributions from various other producers, including DJ Toomp. The album also features guest appearances from recording artists such as Dwele, T-Pain, Lil Wayne, Mos Def, DJ Premier, and Chris Martin of Coldplay. The cover art and its interior artwork were designed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.\n\nThe coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow American rapper 50 Cent's Curtis (2007) generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. The success of the former and the outcome of its competition with the latter marked the end of the dominance of gangsta rap in mainstream hip-hop. This is credited with paving the way for other hip-hop artists who did not conform to gangster conventions to find commercial acceptance.\n\nGraduation debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling over 957,000 copies in the first week of sales. It has since sold over 5 million copies in the United States and been certified quintuple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Five accompanying singles were released, including the international hits \"Stronger\", \"Good Life\" and \"Homecoming\", with the former of the three topping the US Billboard Hot 100. The album received widely positive reviews from music critics, with several of them praising the production, and earned West his third Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, as well as his third nomination for Album of the Year. It was named as one of the best albums of 2007 by multiple publications, including Rolling Stone and USA Today, while also listed among numerous decade-end lists and later named to the lists of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and NME's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Graduation\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

There, he worked on the album in a communal recording environment that involved numerous contributing musicians and producers. Guest vocalists on the album include Nicki Minaj, Rihanna, Bon Iver, Jay-Z, Pusha T, Rick Ross, Kid Cudi, John Legend, Elton John and Raekwon.\n\nProduction was primarily handled by West, with additional production from a variety of high-profile record producers including Mike Dean, No I.D., Jeff Bhasker, RZA, S1, Bink, and DJ Frank E. Noted by critics for its maximalist aesthetic, opulent production quality, and dichotomous themes, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy incorporates aspects of West's previous works, including soul, baroque, electro, and symphonic styles. The album deals with themes of excess and celebrity, and explores such issues as consumer culture, race, and the idealism of the American Dream.\n\nTo promote the album, West released free songs through his G.O.O.D. Fridays series, and four singles: the Billboard hits POWER, Monster, Runaway, and the international hit All Of The Lights. The album was also promoted with a short film directed by West called \"Runaway\" set to the album's music, functioning as a companion piece to the record. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and has since been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA for having sold over 3,000,000 copies in the United States as of 2022. \n\nIn its first week of release, the album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, selling 496,000 copies. The entry blocked Nicki Minaj's debut album Pink Friday from the top spot with 375,000 sales; the week marked the first time in two years that the chart had two albums bow with over 300,000 units. It also gave West his fourth consecutive US number-one album and surpassed the 450,000 first-week sales of 808s & Heartbreak, with the debut becoming the fourth-best sales week of 2010. The album's first-week digital sales of 224,000 units accounted for 45% of the total and stood as the fourth-highest digital copies for an album in a week.\n\nIn its second week on the Billboard 200, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy descended six places to number seven with 108,000 copies sold, marking a 78% sales decline while remaining above Pink Friday by one place. The album lasted for 115 weeks on the Billboard 200, and as of July 2013, it has sold 1,300,000 copies in the United States, as reported by Nielsen SoundScan. By June 2011, the album had sold 483,000 digital copies, ranking as the second best-selling digital rap album ever. On November 23, 2020, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for pushing 3,000,000 certified units in the US. According to Billboard, as of 2022, My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is one of the 15 best-performing 21st-century albums without any of its singles being number-one hits on the Hot 100.\n\nMy Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy was a chart-topper in Canada, giving West his fourth number-one album on the Canadian Albums Chart. It was less successful in Denmark, reaching number four on the Danish Albums chart. On March 9, 2021, the album was certified double platinum by IFPI Danmark for shipments of 40,000 in Denmark. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy opened at number six on the ARIA Albums chart and on September 10, 2021, it was awarded a double platinum certification from the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for over 140,000 copies shipped in Australia. The album charted within the top 10 in Norway, South Korea, New Zealand, and Switzerland. In 2018, it was reported that My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy had been streamed a billion times on Spotify.\n\nWidely considered West's magnum opus, the album was an immediate and widespread critical success. It became the first new release to be rated a perfect 10 by Pitchfork since  Wilco's 2002 album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, became West's third studio album to top the Village Voice's annual year-end Pazz and Jop critics' poll, was named the best album in many publications' year-end and decade-end lists (including Rolling Stone, Billboard, Pitchfork, Stereogum, and The A.V. Club), and has since appeared on several lists ranking the Greatest Albums of All-Time, including on Rolling Stone Magazine's 2020 List of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time, and NME's 2013 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/My+Beautiful+Dark+Twisted+Fantasy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Taking influences from 80s new wave, synthpop, and art pop, West produced the album with heavy use from the Roland TR-808 drum machine and Auto-Tune. Lil' Wayne, Young Jeezy, Kid Cudi, and Mr. Hudson appear as featured artists on the album. Due to the lack of profanity, 808s & Heartbreak is West's first album without the Parental Advisory logo.\n\nCommercially, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart. The album has (as of 2022) sold over 3,700,000 copies, and has been certified 3x platinum by the RIAA. Lead single Love Lockdown peaked at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, and second single Heartless peaked at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in early 2009. \n\nReleased to a polarizing reaction from the public and critics alike, 808s & Heartbreak has since gone to become hailed as one of the greatest and most influential albums of the all time, with the album being attributed to the breakout popularity of more 'emotionally vulnerable' hip-hop artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake, and pioneering the 'emo rap' and 'alternative R&B' subgenres in particular. Rolling Stone magazine selected 808s among its '40 Most Groundbreaking Albums of All Time' list in 2014, and eventually ranked the album at 244 on its 2020 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/808s+&+Heartbreak\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

West collaborated with American record producer and composer Jon Brion to produce Late Registration, and the album features guest contributions from artists such as Jay-Z, Common, Lupe Fiasco, Jamie Foxx, Nas, Brandy, and Adam Levine, among others.\n\nThe production is notably more lush and elaborate than West's previous album, The College Dropout. By collaborating with Jon Brion, West was able to utilize production styles and instruments not commonly associated with hip-hop music. More intricate sampling methods and the inclusion of string arrangements meant that the production featured on the album was unique to hip-hop music. West sought to deliver lyrics that allowed him to continue his style of storytelling during songs, and the album covers topics of social issues, such as poverty, drug trafficking, health care, and blood diamond trades.\n\nThe album produced five singles, including the international hits \"Touch the Sky\", \"Heard 'Em Say\" and \"Gold Digger\", the last of which topped the Billboard Hot 100 at number one. Music videos for all five singles were produced. Late Registration debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, selling 860,000 copies in its first week. The album has sold over 3.1 million units in the United States and has been certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nUpon its release, Late Registration received rave reviews from music critics and earned West several accolades, including a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 2006 Grammy Awards and an Album of the Year nomination. It appeared at the top of several publications year-end lists of top albums. Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2005, and included it at number 118 on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\" in 2012. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kanye+West/Late+Registration\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Containing poignant lyrics detailing heartache, \"drivers license\" is an atmospheric power ballad built around bedroom pop, power pop and indie pop. It is characterized by a minimalist production incorporating kick drums, harmonies, syncopated hand-claps, and a dreamy bridge.\n\nThe song documents the \"multifaceted\" emotions Rodrigo endured after a heartbreak. She teased the song on her social media for many months in 2020, before announcing it on January 4, 2021. The official music video was posted to YouTube alongside the song's release, in which Rodrigo drives around a suburban area after receiving her driver's license, and reminisces over her memories of the song's subject who encouraged her to receive the license. \"Drivers License\" was met with critical acclaim; praise centered on Rodrigo's cathartic songwriting, emotional vocals, and the song's stirring production, with many underscoring its Taylor Swift and Lorde influences.\n\n\"drivers license\" broke a string of records, including the Spotify record for the most single-day streams for a non-holiday song (achieved on its fourth day of release), the biggest first-week for a song on Spotify and Amazon Music. The song topped the US Billboard Hot 100 as one of the most dominant number-one hits in history, and made Rodrigo the youngest artist ever to debut atop the chart. It was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. Elsewhere, \"drivers license\" reached number one in many countries, including Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Israel, Malaysia, Portugal, and Singapore, as well as spending multiple weeks atop the charts in Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It also peaked within the top ten in Brazil, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and various others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Olivia+Rodrigo/drivers+license\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

At the 64th Annual Grammy Awards, the album and its title track received a total of seven nominations, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album, Song of the Year and Record of the Year.\n\nSeven singles were released in promotion of the album: \"My Future\", \"Therefore I Am\", \"Your Power\", \"Lost Cause\", \"NDA\", the title track, and \"Male Fantasy\"; the first three peaked within the top 10 of the US Billboard Hot 100. \"Therefore I Am\" was the highest-charting song from the album, peaking at number two, followed by \"My Future\" at number six, and \"Your Power\" at number 10. Happier Than Ever debuted atop the Billboard 200, becoming Eilish's second number-one album in the United States, and topping the album charts in 27 other countries. A Disney+ documentary concert film, Happier Than Ever: A Love Letter to Los Angeles, was released on September 3, 2021 and received a nomination for Best Music Film at the 2022 Grammys. To promote the album further, Eilish embarked on her fifth concert tour, titled Happier Than Ever, The World Tour, set to cover Europe, Oceania and North America in 2022.\n\nUpon release, Happier Than Ever received acclaim from music critics, who admired its resolute portrayal of teenage stardom contrasting its muted sound. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from publications, the album has a weighted mean score of 86 based on 27 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Billie+Eilish/Happier+Than+Ever\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

SZA and Drake contribute guest vocals.\n\nCompared to the radio-friendly dance tunes of her previous albums, ANTI is more muted and soulful. Its songs explore eclectic styles spanning pop, dancehall, alternative R&B, hip hop, soul, psychedelic, doo-wop and trap.\n\nThe artwork was designed by Israeli artist Roy Nachum, and was described by Rihanna as her \"favorite album cover\". The album's front cover shows an image of Rihanna, which was taken on her first day of day care, holding a black balloon, with a gold crown covering her eyes; the majority of the artwork is black and white with a \"smattering\" of red paint. Speaking about the cover art's concept, Nachum stated that he painted a young Rihanna to represent her \"bringing something new\" to music.\n\nANTI topped the list of 101 Best Albums of the 2010s by SPIN magazine, as well as being featured on the top 10 of Billboard's and NME's respective lists.\n\nThe album reached the summit of the Billboard 200 for 2 non-consecutive weeks. During its second week atop the chart, lead single \"Work\" topped the Billboard Hot 100 simultaneously, marking the second time Rihanna achieved the feat in her career.\n\nAs of 2022, it has received a triple platinum certification in the United States for 3,000,000 copies sold and 4.5 billion streams on Spotify. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Rihanna/ANTI+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album features guest appearances from Don Toliver, Phoebe Bridgers, Travis Scott, and the late Ol' Dirty Bastard.\n\nSOS is primarily an R&B album with influences from hip hop and pop. The album samples sound references from soul, gospel, jazz and melodic rap. The sound of the album was described as \"a varied palette\", combining \"surf rock\" and \"grunge\" elements, alongside \"her beloved lo-fi beats\". In Complex, she described the album's sound: \"I have no idea what it sounds like to anybody else. I really don't know. It's so bizarre. It's weird that I can't put my finger on it. It's a little bit of everything.\" She added that some parts of the song had an \"aggressive\" sound whereas others were soft or balladic. During the Rolling Stone interview, she and Punch spoke in length about the album's composition. The inspiration in question was eclectic, drawing from jazz, alternative rock, \"traditional\" R&B, country, and hip hop. About the wide range of genres incorporated into the album, SZA said she did not care if her production choices made the album sound incohesive, because to her, \"if you sound like you, your shit’s going to be cohesive. Period.\" Punch commented: \"It's a new chapter. She's not scared to try certain things now.\"\n\nSOS has received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 based on reviews from critics, the album received a score of 90 out of 100, based on 20 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/SZA/SOS\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on July 10, 2012, by Def Jam Recordings.\n\nAfter releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra in 2011, Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who assisted him with recording his debut album at EastWest Studios in Hollywood. Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song structure differently on Channel Orange. Other producers to work on the album included Om'Mas Keith and Pharrell Williams. Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the Creator, vocalist/songwriter André 3000, and guitarist John Mayer.\n\nChannel Orange has an unconventional musical style, drawing on electro-funk, pop-soul, jazz-funk, psychedelic music, and nonmusical sounds such as film dialogue and ambient noise that function as interludes. Vocally, Ocean uses a free-form flow as well as alternating falsetto and tenor registers throughout the album. His songwriting explores themes of unrequited love, decadence, class, and drugs through the use of surrealistic imagery, conversational devices, and descriptive narratives depicting dark characters. He titled the album as a reference to the neurological phenomenon grapheme–color synesthesia, through which he perceived the color orange during the summer he first fell in love.\n\nTo prevent Channel Orange from leaking onto the Internet, Ocean and Def Jam released the album digitally one week earlier than its publicly announced date. It was promoted with five singles, including Ocean's highest charting single \"Thinkin Bout You\" (number 32 on the US Billboard Hot 100) and a supporting concert tour in July 2012. Channel Orange debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 and sold 131,000 copies in its first week, eventually selling 621,000 copies in the US by September 2014. Critically, it was the best-reviewed album of 2012 and the year's top-ranked album in numerous critics' lists, including the American Pazz & Jop and the British HMV Poll of Polls. At the 2013 Grammy Awards, Channel Orange was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Urban Contemporary Album. It has been featured in several lists of the best albums of the 2010s and of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/channel+ORANGE\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on August 20, 2016, exclusively on the iTunes Store and Apple Music along with a CD from the Boys Don't Cry Magazine which features an extra verse on \"Nikes\" by KOHH.\n\nBlonde features an abstract and experimental sound in comparison to Ocean's previous releases, encompassing styles such as R&B, pop, soul, avant-garde, indie rock, electronica, psychedelia, and hip-hop. Ocean also notably makes use of pitch shifted vocals. The Beach Boys' de facto leader Brian Wilson is recognized as a strong influence on the album's lush arrangements and layered vocal harmonies, while the guitar and keyboard rhythms on the album are considered as languid and minimal. The album's themes surrounds Ocean dealing with his masculinity and emotions, inspired by sexual experiences, heartbreak, loss and trauma. The album also features guest vocals from André 3000, Beyoncé, and Kim Burrell, among others. Production was handled by Ocean himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers, including Malay and Om'Mas Keith, who collaborated with Ocean on Channel Orange, as well as James Blake, Jon Brion, Buddy Ross, Pharrell Williams, and Rostam Batmanglij, among others.\n\nIn 2013, Ocean confirmed that his follow up to Channel Orange would be another concept album. In April 2014, Ocean stated that his second album was nearly finished. In June 2014, Billboard reported that the singer was working with a string of artists such as Happy Perez (whom he worked with on nostalgia, ULTRA., Charlie Gambetta and Kevin Ristro, while producers Hit-Boy, Rodney Jerkins and Danger Mouse were also said to be on board. Initially known as Boys Don't Cry and teased for a July 2015 release, the album suffered several delays and was the subject of widespread media anticipation leading up to its release. Beginning in 2013 and ending in 2016, recording for the album took place at New York's Electric Lady Studios and, after a period of writer's block, in London at Abbey Road Studios and in Los Angeles' Henson Recording Studios. Its physical release was accompanied by a magazine entitled Boys Don't Cry.\n\nRather than going on a typical promotional tour playing radio festivals and appearing on television shows, Ocean spent a month after the release of Blonde, traveling to countries such as China, Japan and France. He also chose not to submit Blonde for consideration at the Grammy Awards, stating: \"That institution certainly has nostalgic importance... It just doesn't seem to be representing very well for people who come from where I come from, and hold down what I hold down.\"\n\nBlonde received widespread acclaim, with critics praising Ocean's introspective lyrics and the album's unconventional and progressive sounds. Critics also complimented the album for challenging the conventions of R&B and pop music. Supported by its lead single Nikes, the album debuted at number one in several countries, including the United States. It earned first week sales of 275,000 with album-equivalent units in the US, with 232,000 being pure sales, and was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Among other publications, Time named it the best album of 2016. Metacritic named it one of the most critically acclaimed albums of the year by music publications. In 2020, Pitchfork named it the best album of the 2010s and Rolling Stone ranked it at number #79 on their updated list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nThe songs on the album were collectively streamed more than 65.4 million times, second behind only the streams for Views by Drake during that week. Forbes estimated that Blonde earned Ocean nearly one million in profits after one week of availability, attributing this to him releasing the album independently and as a limited exclusive release on iTunes and Apple Music. Blonde has generated 404 million on-demand audio streams for its songs in the US through February 9, 2017, according to Nielsen Music. The album has earned 620,000 album-equivalent units, 348,000 of which were copies sold. On July 9, 2018, Blonde was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\n– Frank Ocean, 2016\n\"Boys do cry, but I don't think I shed a tear for a good chunk of my teenage years. It's surprisingly my favorite part of life so far. Surprising, to me, because the current phase is what I was asking the cosmos for when I was a kid.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Frank+Ocean/Blonde\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "OK Computer is the third album by the English rock band Radiohead, released in 1997. It reached #1 on the UK Albums Chart and marked Radiohead's highest entry into the American market at the time, where it debuted at #21. OK Computer expanded the band's worldwide popularity, becoming the last Radiohead album to have a delayed release outside of the United Kingdom. As of 2007, it has been certified triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US. OK Computer included the singles \"Paranoid Android\", \"Karma Police\" and \"No Surprises\".\n\nThe album was recorded in rural Oxfordshire and Bath, England with Nigel Godrich, who would work with the band on all their future recordings. Although OK Computer was dominated by guitar, its expansive sound and wide range of influences set it apart from many of the Britpop and alternative rock bands popular at the time, laying the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more experimental work. The lyrics, by Thom Yorke, and the album's artwork by Yorke and frequent collaborator Stanley Donwood, emphasised themes such as consumerism, social disconnection, political stagnation and modern malaise, though the band denied they set out to make a concept album.\n\n\nUpon its release, OK Computer received almost unanimously positive reviews. Consensus among critics was that the album was a landmark of its time and would have far-reaching impact and importance. NME gave the album a ten out of ten score, and reviewer James Oldham wrote \"Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. In short, here is a landmark record of the 1990s, and one that deserves your attention more than any other released this year.\" Taylor Parkes of Melody Maker connected the album's release to the era's feeling of paranoia and alienation about millenarianism, and said \"It's as pained and as slow-moving as the emotions that inspired it. ... In one way or another, Radiohead have excelled themselves.\" Q awarded the album five out of five stars, with writer David Cavanagh stating that \"the majority of OK Computer's 12 songs ... takes place in a queer old landscape: unfamiliar and ominous, but also beautiful and unspoiled. ... It's a huge, mysterious album for the head and soul.\" Nick Kent wrote in Mojo that \"Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I'm betting OK Computer will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era.\" In a four out of five stars review, Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian wrote that the album \"is surprising and sometimes inspiring but its intensity makes for a demanding listen.\"\n\nThe album was also favourably received by critics in North America. Rolling Stone gave the album four out of five stars. Reviewer Mark Kemp wrote that the album is \"a stunning art-rock tour de force ... On OK Computer, Radiohead take the ideas they had begun toying with on The Bends into the stratosphere. ... OK Computer is evidence that Radiohead are one rock band still willing to look the devil square in the eyes\", but warned \"OK Computer is not an easy listen.\" An Entertainment Weekly review by David Browne gave the album a B+, and wrote that \"When the arrangements and lyrics meander or sprout pretensions, the album grows ponderous and soggy. For all of Radiohead's growing pains, though, their aim — to take British pop to a heavenly new level — is true.\" In an article for The New Yorker, writer Alex Ross praised OK Computer for its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the more musically conservative \"dadrock\" of their contemporaries Oasis. Ross wrote that \"Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme  This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock.\" Ryan Schreiber wrote, in a highly enthusiastic ten out of ten review in his online music magazine Pitchfork, that \"Radiohead's third piece of incredible work, OK Computer, is not only their best yet, but one of the year's greatest releases. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.\"\n\nDespite OK Computer's widespread praise, it also received some criticism. Robert Christgau of the Village Voice granted OK Computer a B− but ranked it as the \"Dud of the Month\" in his consumer guide; Christgau commented that the album lacked \"soul\", calling it \"arid\" and \"ridiculous\" and comparing it unfavourably to Pink Floyd. Andy Gill wrote for The Independent in an otherwise positive review, \"For all its ambition, OK Computer is not, finally, as impressive as The Bends, which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that so luxuriates in its despondency\". While a review in Time was largely positive, particularly praising the songs \"Airbag\", \"Paranoid Android\", and \"Let Down\", reviewer Christopher John Farley criticised the second half of the album. Farley stated, \"While the first half-dozen tracks reward repeated listenings with melodies that grow and bloom with familiarity, there is often no structure to be found in the remaining half-dozen numbers.\"\n\nAt the end of 1997, OK Computer appeared in many critics' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. OK Computer topped the year-end polls of the magazines Mojo, Vox, Entertainment Weekly, Hot Press, Muziekkrant OOR, HUMO, Eye Weekly, and Inpress, and tied for first place with Daft Punk's Homework in The Face. The album placed second in NME, Melody Maker, Rolling Stone, Village Voice, Spin and Uncut. Q and Les Inrockuptibles both listed OK Computer in their unranked year-end polls. OK Computer was a nominee for the 1997 Mercury Prize, a prestigious award recognizing the best British or Irish album of the year. The album was nominated in the Album of the Year and Best Alternative Music Performance categories at the 1998 Grammy Awards, ultimately winning the latter award.\n\nOK Computer first appeared in a \"best of all time\" list three months after its release, placing 16 in a chart based on submissions by customers of Virgin Megastores. This chart heavily favoured recent releases, which suggested that OK Computer's popularity was a passing fad. However, OK Computer has since appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. In early 1998, OK Computer topped a Q reader's poll of the greatest albums of all time, and in 2001 Q placed it at number one in a list of the top 50 pop albums of the last 15 years. A number of publications, including NME, Melody Maker, Spin, Alternative Press, Pitchfork Media, and Time placed OK Computer prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Additionally, retrospective reviews from The A.V. Club and Slant Magazine have received the album favourably; likewise, Rolling Stone gave the album five stars in the 2004 Rolling Stone Album Guide, with critic Rob Sheffield saying \"Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by Nirvana, Pearl Jam, U2, R.E.M., everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering.\"\n\n\nOK Computer was recorded in the lead up to the 1997 general election. It was thus seen by critics as encompassing public opinion through its \"despairing-yet-hopeful tone\" and themes of alienation. Yorke said his lyrics had been affected by reading a book about the two decades of Conservative government which were just coming to an end in 1997, as well as about factory farming and globalisation. However, in interviews Yorke expressed little hope things would change under the \"New Labour\" government of Tony Blair. With the approach of the year 2000, many people felt the tone of the album was millennial.\n\nSome critics have credited OK Computer with \"killing\" 1990s Britpop, as within a few years of its release, the dominant style of UK guitar pop had become slower and more melancholy. Many of the newer acts used similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements. The band Travis worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of The Man Who, which became the biggest selling album of 1999 in the UK. Others have credited Radiohead with beginning a mainstream revival of progressive rock and ambitious concept albums, though the band denied their affiliation with the genre. Radiohead described the prevalence of bands that \"sound like us\" as one reason to break with the style of OK Computer for their next album, Kid A. When asked by MTV interviewer Gideon Yago what the band thought of \"bands like Travis, Coldplay, and Muse ... making a career sounding exactly like Radiohead did in 1997\", Yorke replied \"Good luck with 'Kid A'!\".\n\nSeveral rock bands which later became popular, ranging from Coldplay and Bloc Party to TV on the Radio, have said they were formatively influenced by OK Computer—TV on the Radio's debut album, for instance, was titled OK Calculator. Additionally, the album's popularity paved the way for British alternative rock bands such as Muse, Snow Patrol, and Keane. Classical and jazz musicians such as Christopher O'Riley and Brad Mehldau have performed material from OK Computer, and composer Esa-Pekka Salonen said \"When I heard 'OK Computer,' after five minutes I said, 'I actually get this. I understand what these people are trying to do.' And what they were trying was not so drastically different from what I was trying to do.\" Radiodread is a song for song cover of the album in a Reggae style.\n\nOK Computer has received great acclaim from the public and critics. It is often cited as Radiohead's best work and as a landmark album of its time. In 1998, it was nominated for a Grammy Award as Album of the Year, and won for Best Alternative Music Album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/OK+Computer\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was released in North America on January 1, 2008. In Rainbows was Radiohead's first release after the end of their contract with EMI and the end of the longest gap between studio albums in their career.\n\n\"In Rainbows\" was recorded in London, Somerset, Wiltshire, and Oxfordshire with producers Mark Stent and Nigel Godrich. Radiohead worked on the songs for more than two years, beginning in early 2005. In between recording, the band toured Europe and North America for three months in 2006. Radiohead used a wide variety of musical styles on the album, incorporating string arrangements and electronic music, pianos, celestes and the ondes Martenot, yet renewing their focus on guitars, drums, and bass as lead instruments. The songwriting on In Rainbows was more personal than that of Radiohead's other work, with singer Thom Yorke describing it as his attempt to write \"seduction songs\".\n\n Upon its retail release, In Rainbows entered the United World Chart, UK Album Chart, and the U.S. Billboard 200 at number one. \"In Rainbows\" also earned widespread critical acclaim, and several publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2007. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/In+Rainbows\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This snippet is sampled by the band in the song \"How Do You?\". The album includes the single \"Creep\", Radiohead's most well-known hit on mainstream radio. Pablo Honey peaked at #22 in the UK charts and went platinum there and in other countries.\n\nAfter a long dormancy while the members attended university, the band On a Friday reconvened in the early 1990s, becoming fixtures on the local Oxford scene with a series of demo recordings and well attended live gigs, finally signing with EMI/Parlophone and changing their name to Radiohead. The band's first official release, the Drill EP, was produced by their managers Chris Hufford and Bryce Edge, and sold poorly. For their debut album the band sought the production skills of Massachusetts-based Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade, responsible for Dinosaur Jr. and Buffalo Tom albums of which they were fans.\n\nSeveral months in advance of the album, the band came out with their debut single \"Creep\". According to bassist Colin Greenwood, \"Creep\" had been written by singer/rhythm guitarist Thom Yorke sometime in the late 1980s, while he was at Exeter University, and was shared with other members of the band, who were mostly very enthusiastic, citing the song as a reason to continue making music together. However, it was not included on any of their early '90s demo tapes and had not been a part of their live set. At the time, \"Inside My Head\" (which would later be released as a b-side to \"Creep\") was considered a good candidate for the band's lead single.\n\nSometime in 1992 the band began an impromptu performance of \"Creep\" at a recording session, referring to it as their \"Scott Walker song\" because it reminded them of one of their musical idols. Rumour states that Jonny Greenwood's famous guitar crunches in the chorus were supposedly an attempt to ruin a song he didn't like. But \"Jonny played the piano at the end of the song and it was gorgeous,\" stated producer Paul Kolderie (though the piano was mixed in at the wrong time, the band decided to keep the take complete with mistake, not for the last time). \"Everyone who heard 'Creep' just started going insane. So that's what got us the job doing the album.\" As soon as their managers and producers realized the song was an original (not a Walker cover), other plans were put on the back burner, to the band's surprise, and \"Creep\" was released as a limited single to the public in late 1992. However, the single initially went nowhere. It was even blacklisted from Radio 1 for being too depressing. In the meantime the bulk of the album was recorded, in autumn 1992. Recording sessions were completed very quickly, as the band had been playing many of these songs for years. However, what ended up on Pablo Honey represents only a fraction of their On a Friday-era recorded material, with very little overlap with earlier demos. The album was once described by a Radiohead member as 'Our greatest hits as an unsigned band', with smooth sonic textures, anthemic vocals and walls of guitar noise. \"Prove Yourself\", which had led off Drill, reappears however in a different recording, as do \"You\" and \"Thinking About You\" in reworked versions.\n\nIn the heady alternative musical climate of 1993, Pablo Honey did not receive particular attention. Upon release, however, the critical reaction to Pablo Honey tended towards the positive, with Rolling Stone, NME, Allmusic, Q Magazine and Entertainment Weekly giving favourable reviews.\n\nBesides \"Creep\", the album also included the melodic, perhaps ironic, and Sonic Youth-influenced single \"Anyone Can Play Guitar\" and U2-like single \"Stop Whispering\". Also on Pablo Honey are ethereal rocker \"You\", fan favourite \"Thinking About You\", and \"Blow Out\", the latter of which is apparently the band's personal favourite from the album, and points ahead to their future sonic manipulations.\n\nBy mid-1993, \"Creep\" had become a hit in Israel, then the United States, and then a worldwide hit, finally reaching number 7 when it was re-released during the Autumn of 1993 in the band's native Britain. \"Creep\" went on to define the band's early career, at the expense of anything else on Pablo Honey. The song, whose self-loathing lyrics struck a chord with many fans, was released around the same time as other so-called \"slacker\" anthems such as Beck's \"Loser\" and was seen by some as a part of the grunge movement kicked into high gear by Seattle bands Nirvana and Pearl Jam. Radiohead eventually fell into a media-created niche as the \"British Nirvana\", due both to \"Creep\" and to the equally morose (if not equally successful) other songs on the album. In fact, Radiohead did share similar influences as Nirvana, notably the Pixies and R.E.M., although The Smiths were also a large influence on the band at this time. By their next album, The Bends (1995), Radiohead was more often being lumped by the press with the Britpop or \"Brit-rock\" movement, a reflection of changing trends.\n\nHowever, the band are not unanimously pleased with \"Creep\". Although at first ecstatic at their success, they soon came to resent being unable to escape its shadow, inspiring the bitter song \"My Iron Lung\". When performing live in 1993 and 1994, much of the audience would often leave after \"Creep\" had been performed, ignoring all the other material from Pablo Honey. One exception was \"Prove Yourself\", a song Yorke removed from setlists after he realised the crowd would always chant along with its disturbing refrain, \"I'm better off dead.\"\n\nBy the mid-'90s as the band's style evolved and they became more confident about their newer material, the band and Yorke in particular came to believe \"Creep\" had been given too much weight, and by the late '90s, Yorke apparently no longer identified at all with their biggest hit. The clip for \"Creep\" was conspicuously absent from their official 1997 video compilation release 7 Television Commercials (none of the other videos from Pablo Honey were included, either). For a time, the band refused to play it live, but beginning in 2001 it has been aired several times as an encore. The videos from Pablo Honey have since been released by EMI on the 2008 DVD Radiohead: The Best Of.\n\nOther songs from Pablo Honey have received even less recent attention from the band. Besides \"You\" (which was performed live by special request once in 2002), very occasional performances of \"Creep\", and the surprising performances of \"Blow Out\" in Tokyo during their 2008 tour, the dreamy \"Lurgee\" is the only other song from Pablo Honey that has been played live by the band since the OK Computer era. The band, however, have said in recent years that they are not unhappy with the album or its production, given their lack of experience at the time. Radiohead members have mentioned \"Blow Out\" as the Pablo Honey track of which they are most proud. Apart from \"Creep\", the album itself is rarely mentioned by the band today, and The Bends is usually considered a more notable album by those who prefer Radiohead's early rock sound. However, Pablo Honey continues to sell steadily, and has attained platinum status. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Pablo+Honey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, it failed to build on the commercial success of their single \"Creep\" outside the United Kingdom, and it peaked on the American charts at number 88. Although it lacked the instant success of later Radiohead albums, The Bends achieved triple platinum sales certifications in the UK and Canada and platinum sales in the US and the EU.\n\nAccording to the band, The Bends marked the start of a gradual turn in Yorke's songwriting from personal angst to the more cryptic lyrics and social and global themes that would come to dominate the band's later work. Most of the album was seen to continue the lyrical concerns of Pablo Honey, although in more mature fashion. The songs \"Fake Plastic Trees\" and, in particular, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" and its b-side \"Talk Show Host\", are often seen as a precursor to their next album OK Computer (1997). \"Fake Plastic Trees\" was partly inspired by the commercial development of Canary Wharf, while \"Sulk\" was written as a response to the Hungerford massacre. According to Yorke, \"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\" was inspired by the book The Famished Road by Ben Okri.\n\nThe lyrics to the songs on The Bends, particularly those of \"My Iron Lung\", were cited in the British music press as an example of Yorke's alleged depression. Melody Maker ran an article during The Bends period which suggested Yorke would be the next \"rock 'n roll martyr\" or suicide.\n\nThe Bends was the first of the band's full-length records with artwork by Stanley Donwood, in collaboration with Yorke, who went under the name \"The White Chocolate Farm\" (later shortened to Tchock). Originally Yorke had wanted to use an image of an iron lung as the cover, but he lost it. The eventual album cover was created at the last minute by morphing a photograph taken by Donwood of a medical dummy with Yorke's own face. It is also the last Radiohead album whose liner notes and artwork include pictures of the band members.\n\nThe Bends met with much greater critical acclaim than Pablo Honey, appearing on many end-of-year lists in 1995. Within the UK, it assured Radiohead's role as a standard-bearer of \"indie\" Brit-rock bands. The album was released during the height of the '90s Britpop movement, benefiting from renewed press attention to British guitar music; however, in the band's home country, Radiohead's music was rarely grouped with Blur, Pulp and other so-called \"Britpop\" acts, instead receiving some acclaim for diverging from the fashionable aspects of the scene.\n\nIn the United States, the album eventually reached number 88 on the Billboard 200 in 1996, while the single \"High and Dry\" reached number 78 on the Billboard Hot 100. In the UK, The Bends reached number 4 and remains a bestseller. In mid-1995 Radiohead toured as an opening act for R.E.M., playing songs from The Bends and extending their popularity with a mass audience.\n\nThe Bends had an influence on the subsequent generation of British pop bands. In 2006, The Observer listed it as one of \"the 50 albums that changed music\", saying, \"Radiohead's Thom Yorke popularised the angst-laden falsetto, a thoughtful opposite to the chest-beating lad-rock personified by Oasis's Liam Gallagher. Singing in a higher octave-range and falsetto voice to a backdrop of churning guitars became a much-copied idea, however, one that eventually coalesced into an entire decade of sound. Without this, Coldplay would not exist, nor Keane, nor James Blunt.\" Radiohead members said they later distanced themselves from their mid '90s sound partly because they felt little affinity for those that adopted the sound.\n\nThe Bends took second place behind Radiohead's OK Computer in both 1998 and 2006 reader polls of Q magazine for the best album of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 110 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. Rolling Stone initially gave the album an average rating. In 2000, Virgin's Top 1000 Albums of All Time ranked The Bends at number two, second only to Revolver by The Beatles. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/The+Bends\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The sessions produced over 20 tracks; Radiohead saved many of them for their subsequent album, Amnesiac, released the following year.\n\nRadiohead released no singles or music videos to promote Kid A and conducted few interviews and photoshoots, instead becoming one of the first major acts to use the internet as a promotional tool. The album was made available to stream and was promoted with short animated films featuring music and artwork. Bootlegs of early performances were shared on filesharing services and the album was leaked before release.\n\nKid A debuted at the top of the charts in Britain, where it went platinum in the first week, and it became Radiohead's first number-one album in the United States. Like OK Computer, it won a Grammy for Best Alternative Album and was nominated for Album of the Year. Its departure from Radiohead's earlier sound initially divided fans and critics, but it later attracted widespread acclaim; at the turn of the decade, Rolling Stone, Pitchfork and the Times ranked Kid A the greatest album of the 2000s, and in 2012, Rolling Stone ranked it number 67 on its list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Radiohead/Kid+A\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Production was handled by Scott and a number of other record producers including Nav, Vinylz, Mike Dean, Cardo, Frank Dukes, and Allen Ritter, among others.\n\nBirds in the Trap Sing McKnight was supported by three singles: \"Wonderful\", \"Pick Up the Phone\", and \"Goosebumps\". The album received generally positive reviews from critics, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200, earning 88,000 album units in the first week.\n\nOn January 4, 2016, Scott announced on his Snapchat account that he would be revealing the title for his new album at the time. While going on the road, Scott had been tweeting on what the title is to the album on Twitter. He first removed all of his tweets, and announced the title to the album on the Anti World Tour. In an interview with Billboard, Scott explained the meaning of his album title: \"My next album, Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight is basically about all my friends and growing up here . I'm not saying that it's a trap, we not in the fucking projects, but it's like a social trap. It's a social connection trap from what you want to do and how you want to express yourself. I feel like everyone just gets constricted by their parents or just life.\"\n\nOn March 30, 2016, Scott and Young Thug announced that they will be releasing their song in \"the next few days\". In April 2016, while Scott was performing in Houston, Texas, he previewed a snippet of the track. At the Paris Nightclub in Chicago, Illinois, Scott played the full version of the song, called \"Pick Up the Phone\". The duet track between Scott and Young Thug, featuring Quavo. On May 18, 2016, Scott performed a surprise show in Atlanta and confirmed the imminent release for the album, stating \"I'm dropping my new album in a couple of fucking days.\" He went on to reveal that the album will feature \"some of my favorite fucking artists.\"\n\nOn June 2, 2016, Scott took that song down, after posting it on his official SoundCloud page, stating that \"This song was supposed to go to iTunes, but labels are making this more complicated than it actually need to be this was gonna be my single, but now I'm giving a way for the kids. P.S. They might take this down cause they don't want kids to eat.\"\n\nOn July 26, 2016, in a show in the Ford Amphitheater at Coney Island, Scott announced the release date for Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight, however, the album missed its release dates due to \"technical difficulties\" twice. After a free event named the Wav Party in Los Angeles, his music video for \"90210\" was showcased, while his music video for \"Pick Up the Phone\" has been released on Travis Scott's Vevo account on YouTube. Scott also revealed that Kid Cudi and Kendrick Lamar would appear on his album, with the production that would be provided by Cashmere Cat. On August 25, 2016, Mike Dean announced that the album was delayed again, due to the incompletion with the album's mixing. On August 31, 2016, Scott announced that he finally finished his album on his Instagram. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Travis+Scott/Birds+in+the+Trap+Sing+McKnight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Three singles were released to support the album: “Mercury”, ”Bad Habits, and “Sunshine,” in that order.\n\n“I want to love unconditionally now...Someone asked me if I felt pressure to make something that people might like. I felt a disconnect, my eyes squinted as I looked up. As I thought about the question, I realized that we always force a separation between the artist (me) and audience (people). But I am not separate. I am people, I just happen to be an artist. Once I understood this, the album felt very easy and fun to make. Gemini Rights is me getting closer to what makes me a part of all things, and that is: feelings. Feelings seem like the only real things sometimes.“\n\n“I write about my anger, sadness, longing, confusion, happiness, horniness, anger, happiness, confusion, fear, etc., all out of love and all laughable, too. The biggest lesson I learned at the end of this album process was how small we make love. I want to love unconditionally now. I will make love bigger, not smaller. To me, Gemini Rights is a step in the right direction. I’m excited for you to have this album as your own as it is no longer mine. Peace.” — Steve Lacy\n\nApple Music features animated artwork for this release.\n\nThe album includes guest appearances from Fousheé, and Lacy's The Internet bandmate, keyboardist Matt Martians. Incorporating a variety of genres, the album has been described as an amalgamation of indie rock and alternative R&B, with elements of funk, jazz, and psychedelia.\n\nGemini Rights received positive reception from music critics upon its release. The album reached the top ten of the Billboard 200 chart, and topped the Top Rock Albums chart.\n\nLacy produced \"about 90% of the record\" and came up with the title while \"tipsy\" at a bar, also telling Zane Lowe that he wanted Gemini Rights to be concise so listeners could \"make a decision to want to keep playing it again\". Lacy shared that the album is a collective story of him “coming into  after a breakup.” He hoped the album is left to be interpreted by people “ they want to.” Gemini Rights is an album that amplifies the artist’s “majestic mystique” discography, leading Lacy to hit #1 on Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks straight, months following the summer release date in 2022. Gemini Rights is an album that Steve Lacy hopes “will make people feel more unconditional love for one another.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Lacy/Gemini+Rights\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is the follow-up to her second studio album My Everything (2014), and features guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne, Macy Gray and Future. The album was originally titled Moonlight and had the song \"Focus\" as the intended lead single, however after finishing another track on the album she decided to change the album's name to Dangerous Woman and removed \"Focus\" from the album's tracklist, except in Japan, and the album's title track eventually replaced it as the lead single.  Dangerous Woman is primarily a pop and R&B album, with influences of house and dance-pop. Lyrically, the album is about love and destructive relationships and focuses on more mature content than her previous two albums, Yours Truly and My Everything. Grande served as an executive producer on the album, and worked with songwriters and producers such as Max Martin, Ilya and Tommy Brown to achieve her desired sound.\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, earning 175,000 equivalent album units in its first week, with 129,000 coming from pure sales. In the UK, the album debuted at the top slot, becoming her first number one in the country. It also reached the top 5 in 20 countries, including Canada, Japan, Belgium and Switzerland. The lead single \"Dangerous Woman\" was released on March 11, 2016. The second single, \"Into You\", was released on May 6, 2016. Two promotional singles were released for the album, \"Be Alright\" and \"Let Me Love You,\" featuring rapper Lil Wayne.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from critics. Most of them praised Grande's vocals and the mature lyrical content, separating her from her teen-star peers. However, a few criticized the album for containing too many different styles, stating that the Grande should settle for one sound. Grande has promoted the album multiple times on television. She hosted and was a guest performer on Saturday Night Live. She also sang a medley of \"Dangerous Woman\" and \"Into You\" at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Ariana+Grande/Dangerous+Woman\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was also the first time that Parker recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other collaborations.\n\nAfter releasing the group's previous record, Lonerism, Parker began work on Currents, largely recording at his home studio in Fremantle. He engrossed himself with writing and recording, and owing to his reputation as a musical auteur, labored over the details of each song, ultimately causing the release date to be delayed by two months. In contrast to the psychedelic rock sound of the project's prior work, Currents marks a shift to more dance-oriented music, with more emphasis placed on synthesizers than guitars. Parker was inspired to seek a change out of desire to hear Tame Impala's music played in dance clubs and a more communal setting. Thematically, the record is about the process of personal transformation, which many critics interpreted to be the result of a romantic break-up. The album's cover art depicting vortex shedding is a visualization of these themes.\n\nCurrents was preceded by the singles Let It Happen, Cause I'm a Man, Disciples and Eventually. Like its predecessors, the album received critical acclaim. It became the group's best charting release, debuting at number one in Australia, number three in the United Kingdom, and number four in the United States. At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards, Currents was awarded \"Best Rock Album\" and \"Album of the Year\", among other honors that Tame Impala received. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Currents\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album contains two re-recorded songs, \"Desire Be, Desire Go\" (previously released on their self-titled EP) and \"The Bold Arrow of Time\" (previously recorded, but unreleased).\n\nPast Tame Impala releases were done by Kevin Parker purely for his own enjoyment. InnerSpeaker marks the first time Parker has \"recorded something for an intended release. In the past  just recorded a song, then done another two weeks later and eventually put them together.\" While Tame Impala tour as a band, it is Parker's personal music project in which he writes and records all the music to. Commenting on this, Parker said \"Tame Impala is just one sliver of the giant amount of noise-making that we do as a circle of friends. I don't feel bad doing the recording by myself because I don't expect that input in their bands...to us Tame Impala is just Kevin Parker's project and everyone has a project\" and \"Tame Impala has always been a solo project. It has two halves: one half is the recording side which is very calculated and pieced together, and the other side is the live side, where we take what's been recorded and turn them into live songs.\" Parker has been recording music solo for a long time, as he explains \"I’ve always recorded music. When I was 12, I used to set up two tape machines and multi-track myself. First, I’d record a beat on the drums, then, I’d play that tape into another tape recorder while playing keyboard; then I’d take that tape and play bass guitar along with the drums and keyboard. I’d keep adding instruments. I did that for a long time until my dad bought me an 8-track, and then I continued recording music by myself, even if I was in other bands at the same time.\" Parker's father \"played a lot of music as a hobby\" and was a \"big influence\" on Kevin. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tame+Impala/Innerspeaker\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gaga described Artpop as \"a celebration and a poetic musical journey\" and an exploration of the \"reverse Warholian\" phenomenon in pop culture. It displays an intentional \"lack of maturity and responsibility\" by comparison to the darker and anthemic nature of Born This Way. Gaga collaborated with various producers on the record, including Paul \"DJ White Shadow\" Blair, RedOne, Zedd and Madeon. Lyrically, Artpop revolves around Gaga's personal views of fame, sex and self-empowerment; references include Greek and Roman mythology. It also features guest vocals from T.I., Too Short, Twista, and R. Kelly.\n\nThe release of ARTPOP was prefaced by a two-day album release party dubbed ArtRave. The album received generally mixed reviews from music critics, but was commercially successful, debuting at number one on United States' Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 258,000 copies, becoming Gaga's second consecutive number one record in the country and selling 757,000 copies. It also topped national record charts in five additional countries and charted within the top ten in over 20. Artpop was the ninth best-selling album of 2013 with 2.3 million copies worldwide, having sold 2.5 million units as of July 2014. It was also included in several year-end lists by music critics and publications.\n\nIn 2019, Lady Gaga announced that she would re-release ARTPOP without 'Do What U Want' feat. R. Kelly and would be changed with Christina Aguilera featuring on some versions. She said that this change is due to the Lifetime documentary 'Surviving R. Kelly' (The documentary talks about R. Kelly sexually abusing women). As of 2020, all streaming services and all CD and Vinyl versions of the record do not have 'Do What U Want' with R. Kelly featuring on the track. \n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lady+Gaga/ARTPOP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As executive producer of the album, Beyoncé took a wider role in its production, co-writing a majority of the songs, choosing which ones to produce and sharing ideas on the mixing and mastering of tracks.\n\nThe tracks in the album are a mixture of uptempo songs and ballads, which are basically inspired by R&B and soul genres; it also features elements of hip-hop and Arabic music. Although Beyoncé remained discreet about her interpretation of the songs, its underlying meanings were attributed by music writers as an allusion to her intimate relationship with then-boyfriend and well-known music mogul Jay-Z. Dangerously in Love received positive reviews from music critics upon its release, with critics praising Knowles' \"artistic leap\". The album also received numerous accolades, earning Beyoncé five Grammy Awards.\n\nDangerously in Love, became a worldwide commercial success, earning multi-platinum certifications in Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 317,000 copies in its first week, earning Beyoncé the highest debut sales among Destiny's Child members' solo albums. Dangerously in Love has sold over 11 million copies worldwide and has produced two number one Billboard singles and multiple top tens. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Beyonc%C3%A9/Dangerously+in+Love\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As of November 2013, the album has sold 242,000 copies in the United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.\n\nOn September 6, 2011, Glover signed with Glassnote. The founder Daniel Glass says \"There's a tremendous sense of rock'n'roll about him, an irreverence and an authenticity, He fits in with our roster because he's alternative. He liked our approach, which is very touring-intensive. Secondly, it's about how progressive he's been online: inclusive of his fans and very liberal with giving away music. He knows his audience.\"\n\nIn late October, he announced that the album would be released on November 15. The album was made available for pre-order on iTunes on November 1, 2011. On the same day, the music video for \"Bonfire\" was released through Gambino's website and YouTube. The album was made available in its entirety for streaming on NPR on November 6, 2011. The album's lead single, \"Bonfire\", was debuted on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show on September 17, 2011. \"Heartbeat\" was released as the album's second single on November 15, 2011, and reached 18 on the US Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles.\n\nOn July 24, 2012, the music video for the song, \"Fire Fly\", was released on Vevo. \"Fire Fly\" was later serviced to British contemporary hit radio on July 30, 2012.\n\nOn January 9, 2013, Gambino released his latest video from Camp, \"L.E.S.\" The song's title is an acronym for the Lower East Side of the New York City borough of Manhattan, the location of the video shoot. Photographer Ibra Ake directed and filmed the video over \"several nights\" on the streets of the Lower East Side, in front of places like Pianos, and riding in cabs around the district; but not once does Gambino appear himself. While on tour in the summer of 2012, Gambino played this video in the background while he performed \"L.E.S.\" onstage. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Childish+Gambino/Camp\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, the U2-esque epic rock of the album's opening track Politik, the piano-driven Clocks, and the loud guitars of A Whisper were seen to extend the band's musical range. The album also had greater use of piano than Coldplay's debut album or that of many other rock bands popular at the time. Clocks, a song centered around a cyclic piano riff and included on the album only at the last minute, ultimately became the band's largest hit to date, earning the band a Grammy for Record of the Year.\n\nA Rush of Blood to the Head also won the 2002 Grammy for Best Alternative Album. The album received generally excellent reviews, and many critics considered it better than Coldplay's first album, Parachutes. In 2003, the album was ranked number 473 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time.\n\nIn 2007, The National Association of Recording Merchandisers and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame released a list of what they term \"The Definitive 200 Albums of All-Time\". A Rush of Blood to the Head ranks at #65 on the list. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/A+Rush+of+Blood+to+the+Head\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was Coldplay's first to be produced by Eno, and also their first album to not be produced by long-time Coldplay producer, Ken Nelson. The band forced themselves to explore new styles, as Eno required every song on the album to sound different. Development of the album delayed the release date several times. The album cover of Viva la Vida is the 1830 painting Liberty Leading the People by Eugène Delacroix.\n\nViva la Vida was both a critical and commercial success. It won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and was also nominated for Album of the Year. It was the best-selling album of 2008.

The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple.

                    "content": "X&Y is the third studio album by English alternative rock band Coldplay, released 7 June 2005 in the United Kingdom via the record label Parlophone. The album, which features influences of electronic music, was produced by the band and British record producer Danton Supple. British record producer Ken Nelson was supposed to produce much of the album, however, many songs written during their sessions were ditched due to the band's dissatisfaction. The album's cover art is a combination of colours and blocks, which is a representation of the Baudot code. The code should mean \"X&Y\", but it is misspelled. It actually means \"X9Y\".\n\nThe album has been considered a landmark achievement of the band, topping many charts worldwide, including the United Kingdom and United States, the latter being their first. With accumulated sales of over 8.3 million units, X&Y is 2005's best-selling album worldwide. Reviews for the album were mixed; many critics felt X&Y fell short of its predecessor, A Rush of Blood to the Head. The album has spawned the singles \"Speed of Sound\", \"Fix You\", \"Talk\", \"The Hardest Part\", \"What If\", and \"White Shadows\".\n\nSpecial Dutch Edition\nThe Dutch edition contains a second disk with the following songs: \n\"Things I Don't Understand\"\n\"Proof\"\n\"The World Turned Upside Down\"\n\"Pour Me\" (live @ the Hollywood Bowl)\n\"Sleeping Sun\"\n\"Gravity\"\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Coldplay/X&Y\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "I Love You. is the debut studio album by California alternative band The Neighbourhood. It was released on April 22, 2013, by Columbia Records.\n\nThe tracks on this album expresses a series of angst-ridden themes based on both the vibe and lyrical content of the songs. Bryan Sammis explained to Coup De Main magazine: \"I think that at least in terms of the musical aspect of it, all of us try and get our own emotions out through our instruments, which is not always the easiest thing to do. I think for Jesse Rutherford lyrically, what I really like about him and about us as a band is that a lot of his lyrics aren't necessarily pre-ordained, because he's not trying to force it. A lot of his lyrics are off the top of his head when he first hears the song, because that makes it more natural, it's legitimately what he is thinking about and how he is feeling when he hears that song.\"\n\nReception to I Love You was mixed. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 48, based on 8 reviews. Los Angeles Times critic Mikael Wood wrote that despite the band's mastery of the \"textural know-how\" of contemporary alternative rock, their songs mostly \"stretch out into dreary electro-goth atmospherics\" and \"lack any kind of urgency\". AllMusic editor Tim Sendra found that the album's music rarely deviates from its \"ponderous nature\", ultimately \"leaving the listener with an overall experience that is oppressively grey and joyless\". Kat Rolle of Drowned in Sound deemed its lyrics to be \"inane\" and thematically limited to \"California and sex\", while panning the band's musical approach as unoriginal and calculated for mass appeal.\n\nIn a positive review, Jamie Milton of DIY wrote that the Neighbourhood \"stick to the remarkably fully formed mantra they arrived on the scene chanting\", concluding that I Love You \"achieves what few debuts can, by making one hell of an opening statement\". Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian was critical of the album's \"petulant\" lyrics, which she remarked were \"obviously aimed at teenagers\", but concluded that its \"dreamy melancholy and high-shine production\" and \"traditional songcraft\" may nonetheless appeal to a broader audience. Irish Times critic Jim Carroll remarked that the band's hooky pop songs, such as \"Sweather Weather\" and \"Female Robbery\", can be \"ravishing\", but felt that the album is weighed down by occasional \"fillers\".\n\nThe album track list appears to have undertaken some edits prior to being released publicly, as Kat Rolle commented on the \"late-stage change up\" of \"How\", which appears as the album's opening track. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood/I+Love+You.\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In late 2020, the song \"Daddy Issues\" went viral on TikTok, along with \"Sweater Weather\", a song from the band's debut album I Love You.\n\nThe album received generally mixed reviews. Writing for Exclaim!, Ryan B. Patrick called the record \"a \"see what sticks\" effort; it's slick and polished, but hits varying levels of satisfaction throughout.\"\n\nNatasha West, from DIY, said that \"Wiped Out! delivers a message of heartbreak, hope and heartfelt honesty\" and \"having successfully mixed pop, rock and hip-hop together, it seems like they have finally defined their sound as a band\". A review published by Mojo Magazine, stated, \"The LA quintet still sound like 16-year-old boys... Musically, though, their slick soulful pop-R&B is far more refined\". For Matt Collar, from AllMusic, it \"doesn't hurt that cuts like \"Cry Baby,\" \"Daddy Issues,\" and \"Greetings from Califournia\" counteract the band's somewhat downtempo vibe with catchy melodies and light, dance-oriented beats. As the black & white album cover illustration of a palm tree on a beach implies, this is surf music for street goths and beach bums with bad attitudes\".\n\nKenneth Partridge, from Billboard, wrote, \"The subtler, less stylized Wiped Out! keeps the palm-trees-at-twilight feel, but the sound is more hazy R&B than rock\". David Turner, from Rolling Stone, thinks that \"the warmth of \"Sweater Weather\" and the rest of the Neighbourhood's debut album is gone on Wiped Out!, replaced by a ponderous kind of cool\". Uncut's published review was that the album is \"a stylistic and conceptual vacuum.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Neighbourhood/Wiped+Out!\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is also the first album in Spotify history to have all of its tracks surpass 5M streams on its first day.\n\nThe album is the product of a chain reaction. Had the pandemic not thrown his world into a tailspin in early 2020, he would’ve continued to tour behind Fine Line, his critically adored sophomore album, and played its songs hundreds of times for sold-out crowds around the world. A return to the studio was planned, of course, but when COVID-19 canceled those plans too, Styles faced an empty calendar for the first time in a decade. The singer opted to use this free time carefully, taking a solo road trip through Italy and visiting with family and friends for rare long, drawn-out stretches. It was an important moment of reevaluation. “You miss so many birthdays,” he told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “And eventually it's just assumed you're unable to be at stuff. Finally I was like, ‘I want to balance my life out a bit. Working isn’t who I am, it's something I do. I want to be able to put that down.’”\n\nHis upbeat, lightly electronic third LP riffs on the concept of home, viewing it less as a geographical location and more as a state of mind—his mind. “Imagine it’s a day in my house, a day in my mind,” he said. “What do I go through? I’m playing fun music. I’m playing sad music. I have doubts. I’m feeling stuff.” Because of the pandemic, Styles recorded the songs with a small handful of longtime friends and close collaborators who gathered in a single room to drink wine, write, and play. That intimacy is reflected in the songs, which are conversational and casually confessional, as if he’s thinking out loud. Blending vintage folk rock with flickers of disco and a generally more relaxed sensibility, they illustrate a turning point in Styles’ career as he transitions even further towards career singer-songwriter. “For a while it was, how do I play that game of remaining exciting?” he says. “But I finally had a moment where I felt like, ‘Okay, I’m not the young thing, so I would like to really think about who I want to be as a musician.’”\n\nHarry's House won the Grammy for Album of the Year in February of 2023. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/Harry%27s+House\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It has been certified platinum in the UK, the US, Australia, Canada, Italy, Brazil, Denmark, Poland, and Mexico. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Harry Styles was the ninth global best-selling album of 2017 with sales of one million copies.\n\nRecording sessions for the album took place in a number of locations, including in Los Angeles, London, and the Gee Jam Hotel Recording Studio in Port Antonio, Jamaica, where Styles and his production team had a two-month writing retreat in the autumn of 2016. The album was primarily recorded at The Village in Los Angeles.\n\nOn 31 March 2017, Styles announced the album's lead single to be \"Sign of the Times\", which was released on 7 April. The album name, artwork, and track list were revealed on 13 April. The album track \"Sweet Creature\" was released as a promotional single on 2 May. Styles performed the songs \"Sign of the Times\" and \"Ever Since New York\" on the 15 April episode of Saturday Night Live.

On 13 May, a day after the album's release, he held a surprise concert at The Garage in London. Styles held a similar show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles on 19 May, and invited Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks to perform as a special guest. Proceeds from both shows were donated to charity. On 15 May, Harry Styles: Behind the Album was released exclusively on Apple Music, a 49-minute documentary film showing footage from his writing and recording sessions in Jamaica and Los Angeles; The Performances version features a full-length live performance of the album filmed at London's Abbey Road Studios.

In support of the album, Styles embarked on his first solo tour, Harry Styles: Live on Tour, which ran from September 2017 through to July 2018 and visited North America, Europe, Asia, Oceania, and South America. On tour, Styles debuted two unreleased songs, \"Oh Anna\" and \"Medicine\", which were originally written for the album.\n\n\"A lot of my influences, and the stuff that I love, is older... I didn't want to put out my first album and be like, 'He's tried to re-create the Sixties, Seventies, Eighties, Nineties.' Loads of amazing music was written then, but I'm not saying I wish I lived back then. I wanted to do something that sounds like me.\"\n\n—Styles in Rolling Stone\n\nThe album debuted atop the UK Albums Chart with first-week sales of 57,000 units, with Styles becoming the second One Direction member to achieve a number one solo album, following Zayn's Mind of Mine in April 2016. It debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 230,000 album-equivalent units, of which 193,000 were pure album sales. It is the highest first sales week for a British male artist's debut full-length album since Nielsen SoundScan began in 1991. Selling 67,000 units in its second week, it fell down to number three.\n\nThe album was ranked number 22 on the list of the top 40 biggest albums of 2017 on the UK Album Chart. It was the fourth best selling album by a British artist worldwide in 2017. According to IFPI, it was the ninth best selling album of 2017, with 1 million copies shipped globally. The album was Sony Music's biggest global seller in the second quarter of 2017. It was the sixth best selling album of 2017 in Mexico.\n\n\"Sign of the Times\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, the song debuted at number four on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single, \"Two Ghosts\", peaked at number 58 on the UK Singles Chart and number 34 on the US Mainstream Top 40 charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Harry+Styles/Harry+Styles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Riot! produced 4 singles: \"Misery Business\", \"Hallelujah\", \"Crushcrushcrush\" and \"That's What You Get\".\n\n\"Misery Business\" is included in the video games Saints Row 2 and Guitar Hero World Tour (the latter featuring a computer-generated replica of lead vocalist Hayley Williams), while \"That's What You Get\" is a playable song on Rock Band 2. \"Crushcrushcrush\" is featured on Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades and is available as a downloadable track for play on both Rock Band games. A cover version of that song is also featured on the game Ultimate Band.\n\nThe album was produced by David Bendeth. Lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained the album was called Riot! because \"For us, the title ‘Riot!’ literally means an unbridled outburst of emotions. When we were writing, it seemed like our thoughts and emotions were coming out so fast that we couldn't control them. It felt like there was a riot within us. So the album takes our passion to a new level; it’s just all raw energy.\"\n\nThe track \"For a Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic\" comes from what lead guitarist Josh Farro reflects as \"putting your faith in someone and they blow it.\" Farro composed the song and gave the demo to Williams. Farro is known as saying \"I wrote the music specifically to be awesome live and to be extremely energetic. It all came out at once. I showed it to Hayley and she just nailed it lyrically. She completely got the feeling I wanted the song to have.\"\nDuring production, Paramore held an online contest entitled \"The Last Song You'll Ever Sing\" where fans submitted videos on YouTube for the opportunity to sing back-up vocals on the track \"Born for This\". The winner was Mary Bonney of McLean, Virginia. On \"That's What You Get\", Steven from Steven's Untitled Rock Show is featured and is credited. The band asked him when he went to the studio.\n\nThe album has yielded four singles, with \"Misery Business\" being the first. Its origins came from a message Williams posted on the band's Live Journal, asking fans to post what they're ashamed of. \"I found that people really were reaching out to someone to spill their guts to,\" she recalls, \"so I did the same thing lyrically in the song and let everything out. It's more honest than anything I've ever written, and the guys matched that emotion musically.\" The song became an instant hit, eventually receiving heavy rotation on MTV and other music television networks.\n\nThe album's second single was \"Hallelujah\". As Williams recounts, \"It's one of the oldest songs we've got, but we wanted to save it for this record, and it's the perfect home for it. It's a claim of victory for both ourselves and our fans.\"\n\nThe album's third single was \"Crushcrushcrush\" and was released January 15, 2008, in the US and the January 23 in the UK.\n\nThe album's fourth single, \"That's What You Get\", was released just over a week after Paramore canceled their European tour to work on \"personal issues\", amidst media speculation of the band breaking up. Williams explained that, given the fragile state of the band, they all thought it best if they kept the shoot low-key, surrounding themselves with their friends and family, keeping it simple. Williams added, \"We had tons of friends there, and it really just felt like a hangout session. And Marcos  was so cool about it. He said, 'Bring your friends.' We shot it in some of our friends' houses, and it just felt so real... and I think it's the first time in a video you're gonna get to see who we really are.\"\n\nThe track \"Born for This\" contains elements from the song \"Liberation Frequency\" taken from the album The Shape of Punk to Come by the influential Swedish hardcore band Refused. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/RIOT!\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Recorded between April and November 2012, the album was described by the band as being a \"statement\" and a reintroduction of the band to the world and to themselves. It is the first album without guitarist Josh Farro, the only album without drummer Zac Farro and the final album with bassist Jeremy Davis before his departure in 2015.\n\nThe album was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen, with lead guitarist Taylor York co-producing on four tracks. In contrast to the band's previous work, the production of Paramore contains the band's experimentation with new musical genres, such as new wave and funk rock, and features three acoustic interludes. Paramore received acclaim from music critics, who praised the band's maturity and experimentation in terms of musicianship as well as Williams' vocals and overall presence on the album. Several publications included the album in their year-end lists, including The A.V. Club and The Guardian.\n\nParamore was a commercial success, debuting at number one on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 106,000 copies. The album also topped the charts in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and New Zealand, where it became their first album to reach its peak. It also became their second chart-topper in the United Kingdom. In March 2016, Paramore was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for sales exceeding 1,000,000 units. The group followed the record release with The Self-Titled Tour in promotion, with European, North American, Asian, Latin American, and Oceania legs announced. In 2014, the band co-headlined Monumentour with Fall Out Boy. A deluxe edition of the album was released on November 24, 2014, which includes two new tracks, a demo, a re-recorded version of \"Hate to See Your Heart Break\", and live tracks of songs from their previous albums.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: \"Now\", \"Still Into You\", \"Daydreaming\", and the Grammy-winning song \"Ain't It Fun\". \"Still Into You\" and \"Ain't It Fun\" have reached the top ten positions on various charts in the United States and have been certified double platinum by the RIAA, making Paramore the first of the band's albums to have produced more than one double-platinum single.\n\nIn November 2022, the band changed the album cover on streaming services to an image of Hayley Williams shot from behind for unknown reasons.\n\nThe recording of Paramore began in April 2012 with the song \"Daydreaming\". After a brief pause, the recording resumed on June 27 of that year and ended on November 1, 2012. It is the first Paramore album released after the departure of Josh and Zac Farro, both of whom left the band in 2010.\n\nThe album was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen, longtime bassist for Beck and Nine Inch Nails, who has previously produced records for M83 and Neon Trees. In an interview with Electronic Musician, Meldal-Johnsen stated he wanted \"the album to sound very visceral and a little bit less locked down and computerized, more 1981 than 2012, with a nod to 2016.\" In an interview with Digital Spy, Taylor York stated \"I don't think we've ever been so proud and satisfied with something we've done.\" On June 29, 2012, the band confirmed that former Nine Inch Nails and current Angels & Airwaves drummer Ilan Rubin would be recording drums for the album.\n\nIn an interview with Rolling Stone, lead vocalist Hayley Williams explained \"That whole time for our band was such a dark season. It was emotionally exhausting, and by the time we got around to the point where we were going to start writing, we just really wanted to enjoy the process of making an album\" when asked about the direction of the band after Brand New Eyes. Regarding the album being self-titled, Williams explained \"The self-titled aspect of the whole thing is definitely a statement. I feel like it's not only reintroducing the band to the world but even to ourselves ... By the end of it, it felt like we're a new band.\" She also stated that she was inspired by Blondie's and Siouxsie and the Banshees' records when writing the new songs: \"They’ve got so much heart and soul in them.\"\n\nOn December 6, 2012, Paramore revealed the name of the album and the release date, as well as the name of the first single from the album. The track list was announced on January 18, 2013, by Alternative Press. During the 2013 Soundwave Festival, Paramore held a listening party in Sydney, New South Wales on February 26, 2013, followed by Melbourne, Victoria two days later, run by Australian Music Channel, Channel V. Williams revealed a section of the lyrics for the song \"Part II\" which the winners were able to hear at the listening parties on a LiveJournal post. Williams told fans that \"'Let The Flames Begin' has been a favorite of ours to play live, as well as being a favorite of most people who come out to our shows... We wanted it to have a sequel. 'Part II' it is!\"\n\nThe vinyl version of the album was streamed beginning on April 1, 2013, for four days, with each day playing one of the four sides. The album was then officially released on April 5, 2013. The band played an acoustic version of \"Hate to See Your Heart Break\" on the BBC Radio 1 Live Lounge on April 3, 2013, announcing that on the same night, the full song would be premiered on their official website. On April 20, 2013, the band released an EP for Record Store Day, titled The Holiday Sessions, released exclusively on a 7\" vinyl, and is composed of the three interludes from this album. A music video for \"Anklebiters\" was released on June 25, 2013. The song, however, was not released as a single.\n\nThe Self-Titled Tour took place from October 15 to November 27, 2013. The Self-Titled Tour took the band through 27 cities across North America, including their first headline show at Madison Square Garden. On August 22, 2013, the band announced their own cruise, called the \"PARAHOY! Cruise\", sailing from Miami to the Bahamas and back on board the Norwegian Pearl, which took place from March 7 to March 11, 2014. On January 9, 2014, the band, along with Fall Out Boy, announced a co-headlining North American tour dubbed, \"Monumentour\", which took place from June 19 to August 31, 2014. On January 22, 2015, Paramore announced \"Writing The Future\", a round of small shows across the United States, closing out the Paramore touring cycle. It lasted from April 27 to May 25, 2015. A deluxe edition of the album was released on November 24, 2014. The deluxe edition includes a new version of \"Hate To See Your Heart Break\" featuring Joy Williams, Paramore's first collaboration.\n\nThe album has been a major commercial success worldwide, debuting at number one in eight countries including the UK, Ireland, Scotland, Argentina, New Zealand, Brazil, and Australia (where it was the eighth consecutive number-one debut on the chart and also the 32nd self-titled album to top the Australian chart). The album also peaked within the top 20 of 9 other countries. In the US, the album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 106,000 copies. This marks the first Paramore album to reach the top spot on the chart.\n\n\"Still Into You\" charted within the top 10 in Australia and Ireland and reached the top 20 in several others. The single topped the UK rock chart and peaked at number 14 in the singles chart, thus becoming the band's second-highest charting single in that country, behind \"Ignorance\" from the band's previous album Brand New Eyes. In the US, the song peaked at number 24, matching \"The Only Exception\" from the same album as the band's highest charting single at the time. It also peaked at number 6 on the US Rock Chart and number 8 in the US Mainstream Top 40. \"Ain't It Fun\" shared similar success, charting within the top 10 in Canada and Hungary. It eventually became Paramore's best-selling single to date in the US, charting at number ten in the Billboard 100, number 2 in the US Mainstream Top 40, and number 1 in the US Rock Chart and Adult Top 40. The single marks the first time a Paramore song has reached the Top 10 in the US. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/Paramore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mostly categorized as a pop punk album, the album received mostly positive reviews and has been labeled a \"scene classic\".\n\nThe album's production took place in Orlando, Florida. Instead of making a major push towards radio, the band's A&R recommended that the band build a fanbase through word of mouth. The album received mixed reviews by music journalism, who praised the voice of Hayley Williams. However, the album had a weak domestic commercial performance: it failed to enter the Billboard 200, though it did reach number 30 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart. The album reached No. 4 on the UK Rock Chart, and in 2010 it managed to reach the place fifty-one the UK Albums Chart and earned certification as a gold record by the BPI. In July 2014, after the group found success with its following records, All We Know Is Falling received gold certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Three singles from the album were released: \"Pressure\", \"Emergency\" and \"All We Know\". None of the singles managed to reach any major chart, although \"Pressure\" was certified gold by the RIAA in 2016 after the band found commercial success with subsequent releases. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Paramore/All+We+Know+Is+Falling\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lyrically, the album visualizes carefree optimism along with failed relationships, pain and loneliness. \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who praised the album's similarity to the work of American artists Michael Jackson and Jason Mraz, although others felt that the album tried too hard to appeal to all groups. About.com's Bill Lamb and Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen called \"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" one of the year's best debut albums.\n\n\"Doo-Wops & Hooligans\" topped the charts in Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 albums chart and was certified seven-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), nine-times platinum by the Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and six-times by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). As of 2020, the album has sold over 15 million copies globally. The first two singles, \"Just the Way You Are\" and \"Grenade\" were successful internationally, topping the charts in the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Subsequent singles \"The Lazy Song\", which topped the charts in the United Kingdom and Denmark, and \"Marry You\" reached the top ten in over ten countries. \"Talking to the Moon\" and \"Count On Me\" had a limited release.\n\nAt the 53rd Annual Grammy Awards in 2011, \"Just the Way You Are\" received a Grammy Award in the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. Doo-Wops & Hooligans received five nominations for the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012, including Album of the Year, Best Pop Vocal Album and Record of the Year and Song of the Year for the single \"Grenade\". It was promoted primarily through the Doo-Wops & Hooligans Tour (2010–2012) and a co-headline tour with Janelle Monáe, called Hooligans in Wondaland Tour (2011), along with a number of television appearances.\n\nThe album’s title refers to the doo-wop music style, of which Bruno’s music is influenced. Mars later explained in an interview that the “doo-wop” part represents the girls, while the “hooligans” part points out at the guys, and he elaborated on this concept later on:\n\n\"I’m a big fan of doo-wop music, my album has a little bit of that influence, with the simplicity of it… You can listen to a thousand doo-wop songs, and it’s the same four chords. But it’s the message behind the song—its straight to the point and it’s beautiful. That’s what you call your girl, your “doo-wop.” I call my girlfriend my “doo-wop”! On this album, I have records that women are going to relate to and men are going to relate to. So, “doo-wops” are for the girls, and “hooligans” are for the guys.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars/Doo-Wops+&+Hooligans\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Encompassing elements of reggae rock, disco and soul music, the album deviates from the \"energetic\" sound aimed during earlier recording sessions for Mars' sophomore output. It serves as the follow-up to his debut record Doo-Wops & Hooligans. Mars's writing and production team, the Smeezingtons, composed the whole record and worked with several past collaborators, Jeff Bhasker and Supa Dups, while enlisting new producers, such as Mark Ronson and Emile Haynie, and no guest vocalists.\n\nThe album was initially planned to be more \"energetic\" than his previous work, but ended up presenting a wide range of styles such as R&B, pop, reggae, rock, disco, funk and soul music. Lyrically, \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" revolves around the theme of relationships, incorporating more explicit lyrics and subjects than his previous material. Critical response to \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" was generally favorable; many reviewers compared Mars's work to that of his previous album, while others deemed its lyrics shallow.\n\nIt debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200, with first week sales of 192,000 copies, and later topped the chart. The record also reached number one in Australia, Canada, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The album was certified six-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), three times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA), Music Canada (MC), Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ) and by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). \"Unorthodox Jukebox\" was the fourth best-selling album in 2013 and it has since sold six million units globally as of 2016. In 2014, Unorthodox Jukebox won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 56th Grammy Awards and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards.\n\n\"Unorthodox Jukebox\" was supported by five singles, including two US Billboard Hot 100 number ones \"Locked Out of Heaven\" and \"When I Was Your Man\", which also experienced commercial acclaim in various countries, with the former also topping the Canadian Hot 100. Subsequently, three other singles (\"Treasure\", \"Gorilla\", and \"Young Girls\") were made available for consumption in 2013, with each one of them having major to moderate success in the United States. The album was further promoted through The Moonshine Jungle Tour, along with various television appearances. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Bruno+Mars/Unorthodox+Jukebox\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "The Queen Is Dead is the third studio album by the English rock band The Smiths. It was released on 16 June 1986 in the United Kingdom by Rough Trade Records and released in the United States on 23 June 1986 through Sire Records. The album reached number two on the UK album chart, maintaining a chart residency for 22 weeks, number 70 on the Billboard  200, and was certified Gold by the RIAA in late 1990. It has sold consistently well ever since.\n\nGuitarist Johnny Marr wrote several songs that would later appear on The Queen Is Dead while The Smiths toured Britain in early 1985, working out song arrangements with bassist Andy Rourke and drummer Mike Joyce during soundchecks. After releasing their September 1985 single, \"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side\" (which is included on \"The Queen Is Dead\" in an updated, slightly re-mixed version), The Smiths turned to recording their third album. Marr produced the album with singer Morrissey, and worked with engineer Stephen Street, who had assumed the same role on the band's previous album \"Meat Is Murder\". Street recalled, \"Morrissey, Johnny and I had a really good working relationship — we were all roughly the same age and into the same kind of things, so everyone felt quite relaxed in the studio\".\n\nAt the time the group was having difficulty with their label Rough Trade, which Street characterised as \"Rough Trade and EMI trying to sign up everything\". Street noted, \"But this didn't get in the way of recording because the atmosphere in the studio was very, very constructive.\" The group recorded \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\" and \"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\" at RAK Studios in northwest London. After a brief tour, the group recorded and mixed the majority of the album at Jacobs Studios in Farnham, Surrey, during late 1985 and early 1986.\n\nThe album's title comes from the name of a chapter of Hubert Selby, Jr.'s cult classic novel \"Last Exit to Brooklyn\".\n\n\"The Queen Is Dead\" finally emerged half a year later, in June 1986, and was previewed by the May single release of \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\", strictly speaking the only single taken from the album. Many encouraged the band to release \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" as a single, but Johnny Marr is said to have wanted an explosive, searing single, along the lines of The Rolling Stones' \"Jumpin' Jack Flash\", to announce that The Smiths had returned from hiatus. It did not fare as well as expected, stalling at number 26 on the British charts.\n\nThe album is popularly regarded as The Smiths' best album. With its unique blend of musical styles (including jangle pop, British Invasion, music hall, rockabilly and punk rock), it quickly became a British sensation and established The Smiths as one of the biggest bands of their era. Both Morrissey and Marr disagree, however, citing its 1987 successor (and unexpectedly final Smiths LP), \"Strangeways, Here We Come\", as their peak.\n\nRolling Stone gave the album a five star rating. Reviewer Mark Coleman remarked on Morrissey's sense of humour and singled out the singer's performance on \"Cemetry Gates\" as a highlight. Coleman concluded, \"Like it or not, this guy's going to be around for a while.\" Pitchfork Media ranked the album as the sixth best of the 1980s. In 2000, Mojo magazine placed \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\" at number 25 on their list of the 100 greatest songs of all time, while VH2 placed it top of their Top 500 Indie Songs chart. In 2003, \"The Queen Is Dead\" was ranked number 216 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time. In 2006 it was named the second greatest British album of all time by NME. In 2006, Q Magazine placed the album at #3 in its list of \"40 Best Albums of the '80s\".\n\nThe song \"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\", was a contender for lead single off the album, but was passed over in favour of \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\". (Later in 1986 it was released as a 7\"-only single in France). It received a belated release in 1992, when it became one of WEA's singles in a programme to promote Smiths re-releases \n\n\"Cemetry Gates\" was Morrissey's direct response to critics who had cried foul over his use of texts written by some of his favorite authors, notably Shelagh Delaney and Elizabeth Smart. Oscar Wilde, who was also accused of plagiarism, figures as a patron saint of Morrissey's in the song's lyrics. A Wilde quote, \"Talent borrows, genius steals\", was etched in the vinyl run-out grooves of the first single off the album, \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\". \"Cemetry Gates\" also has interesting reverberations with fellow English writer Evelyn Waugh's 1948 novel The Loved One, much of which takes place in a cemetery. The novel's main character Dennis Barlow plagiarizes poems by various English poets in his overtures to Aimee Thanatogenos.\n\n\"The Queen Is Dead\", which leads off the album and notably became an expressionistic music video directed by Derek Jarman, starts with a soundbite from Bryan Forbes' 1962 British film The L-Shaped Room. Another instance of Morrissey's fascination with '60s British cinema, the film featured performances by Pat Phoenix (who had already appeared as a cover star on the 1985 single \"Shakespeare's Sister\") and Cicely Courtneidge as an elderly lesbian veteran of the music halls. The soundbite is Courtneidge's character nostalgically singing the World War I song \"Take Me Back to Dear Old Blighty\". The actress had also appeared in a gala performance for Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee called \"God Save the Queen\", and died in 1980.\n\nA few songs, including \"The Queen Is Dead\" and \"Bigmouth Strikes Again\", feature pitch-shifted backing vocals by Morrissey. Morrissey liked to experiment with effects on his voice, so Street ran his voice through a harmoniser for the backing tracks. Street recalled, \"At that time, apart from the harmoniser, he didn't go for much backing vocal or harmony work — he's done that more on recent albums — but he did like to experiment\". The backing vocals are attributed to \"Ann Coates\" on the record sleeve (Ancoats is a district in Manchester, just North East of the city centre).\n\nThe album cover of \"The Queen Is Dead\", designed by Morrissey, features Alain Delon from the 1964 film \"L'Insoumis\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/The+Queen+Is+Dead\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Louder Than Bombs is the third compilation album by English rock band The Smiths, released as a double album on March 30, 1987 by their American record company, Sire Records.\n\nIt peaked at number 62 on the US Billboard 200 album chart. Popular demand prompted their British record company, Rough Trade, to issue the album domestically as well. Upon its release in the UK in May 1987, it reached No. 38 on the British charts. In 2003, the album was ranked No. 365 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and ranked No. 369 on a 2012 revised list. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA in 1990.\n\nThe album was released as the American counterpart to their recent British compilation The World Won't Listen and consisted of all singles and nearly all B-sides that had not at that point been available in the United States, either on single or album, with a few other tracks added. The title is borrowed from a line in Elizabeth Smart's extended prose poem By Grand Central Station I Sat Down and Wept.\n\nThe album was intended to be a substitute for both The World Won't Listen and their 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow, as these had not been released in the United States. This is why the non-single track \"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\" from Hatful of Hollow was included. Single A-sides \"This Charming Man\" and \"How Soon Is Now?\" had already been released in the US as bonus cuts on the LPs The Smiths and Meat Is Murder, respectively.\n\nAs with The World Won't Listen, this compilation includes the scrapped single \"You Just Haven't Earned It Yet, Baby\" (passed over in favour of \"Shoplifters of the World Unite\"), albeit in a different, shorter mix. However, this shorter version of the song was replaced when Bombs was reissued in 2011. Additionally, the Louder Than Bombs version of \"Stretch Out and Wait\" is the version from the B-side of \"Shakespeare's Sister\", which features slightly different lyrics. Also of note is the fact that \"Ask\" appears on both Louder Than Bombs and The World Won't Listen in a slightly different and longer mix than its single version.\n\nDue to the album offering many B-sides (and the \"Sheila Take a Bow\" single) that had never been collected onto an album before, Louder Than Bombs became very popular on import with fans in the UK. To avoid high import prices being paid, the Smiths' domestic record company, Rough Trade, decided to release the compilation as well, provoking cries of outrage by fans who only three months previously had purchased the slimmer single album UK counterpart. The blow was somewhat softened by the fact that the double album retailed at single album price.\n\nAfter WEA acquired the Smiths' back catalogue in 1992, all Smiths albums were re-released at mid price, including Louder Than Bombs.\n\nThe cover art for Louder Than Bombs, designed by Morrissey, features British playwright Shelagh Delaney of Salford, Greater Manchester. The photograph was originally published in the Saturday Evening Post after Delaney, at the age of 19, made her literary debut with the play A Taste of Honey. The play inspired many early lyrics written by Morrissey, and the song \"This Night Has Opened My Eyes\" (included here) is based on the plight of the play's heroine, Jo, an unwed mother. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/Louder+Than+Bombs\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released in February 1985 and became the band's sole number one album in the UK charts during the band's lifetime, staying on the chart for 13 weeks. It reached number 110 in the US. In 2003, the album was ranked number 295 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 greatest albums of all time\". Meat is Murder is also included in the book \"1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die\" (2006). The album's title is shared with the final album track, written by lead singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr who are vegetarians.\nMeat Is Murder is the most eclectic album by The Smiths, with songs in the unique Jangle Pop style of the band.\n\nAfter the relative production disappointment of the band's debut album The Smiths, singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr produced the album themselves, assisted only by engineer Stephen Street. Officially, the record's production is credited to \"The Smiths\", with Rourke and Joyce allowed say about their instruments' sound-levels in the mixing.\n\nThe song \"How Soon Is Now?\", originally issued as the B-side of \"William, It Was Really Nothing\", was added on to the U.S. edition of Meat Is Murder after becoming a success in American dance clubs and on alternative radio (it was also added to post-1992 WEA re-issues of the album). This song was eventually released as a single in its own right in the UK, reaching No. 24 in the charts. Two Meat Is Murder album tracks--\"Well I Wonder\" (from the \"How Soon Is Now?\" single) and \"What She Said\" (from the \"Shakespeare's Sister\" single)--were also originally B-sides of singles.\n\nMeat Is Murder was more strident and political than its predecessor, including the rationality of the title track (Morrissey forbade the rest of the group from being photographed eating meat), the light-hearted \"Nowhere Fast\", the anti-corporal punishment \"The Headmaster Ritual\" and \"Barbarism Begins at Home\". Musically, the band had grown more adventurous, with Marr adding Rockabilly riffs to \"Rusholme Ruffians\" and Rourke playing a funky bass on \"Barbarism Begins at Home\".\n\nAs well as the album being more political than its predecessor, Morrissey also brought a political stance to many of his interviews, courting further controversy. Among his targets were the Thatcher administration, the Monarchy, and Band Aid. Morrissey famously quipped of the last, \"One can have great concern for the people of Ethiopia, but it's another thing to inflict daily torture on the people of England\".\n\nThe subsequent single-only release \"Shakespeare's Sister\" was not a great success in chart terms, nor was \"That Joke Isn't Funny Anymore\", the sole single from the album. Many considered this an odd choice for a single, with its backwards guitar and lack of any consistent hook. The charts reflected this, with it barely cracking the top 50, peaking at 49. September 1985's \"The Boy with the Thorn in His Side\", however, was an indication of bigger things to come.\n\nCover\n\nThe album's sleeve features an edited still from Emile de Antonio's 1968 documentary In the Year of the Pig. The legend on the soldier's helmet originally read \"Make War Not Love\". On vinyl and American CD releases, four copies of the image were used, whereas only one was used on European CD issues (presumably for reasons of legibility).\n\nPersonnel\n\nMorrissey – vocalsJohnny Marr – guitars, pianoAndy Rourke – bass guitarMike Joyce – drumsThe Smiths – producers (all tracks except \"How Soon Is Now?\")John Porter – producer (\"How Soon Is Now?\")Stephen Street – engineer (all tracks except \"How Soon Is Now?\") <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Smiths/Meat+Is+Murder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\"Nevermind\" is the second studio album by the American grunge band Nirvana, released on September 24, 1991. Produced by Butch Vig, \"Nevermind\" was the group's first release on Geffen Records, which signaled its move away from Seattle-based independent record label Sub Pop. Front man Kurt Cobain sought to make music outside of the restrictive confines of the Seattle grunge scene, drawing influence from groups such as the Pixies and its use of loud/quiet song dynamics.\n\nNevermind was a surprise success by late 1991, largely due to the success of its lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". By January 1992 it had replaced Michael Jackson's album Dangerous at number one on the Billboard charts. Nevermind was responsible for bringing alternative rock to a large mainstream audience, and would subsequently be regarded as one of the best rock albums of all time.\n\nNirvana was a band from Aberdeen, Washington, formed by Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic, that had signed to Seattle independent record label Sub Pop. The group released its debut album Bleach in 1989, with Chad Channing on drums. However, Channing left Nirvana in 1990, and the band was in need of a permanent drummer. Upon seeing a show by hardcore punk band Scream, the group's drummer, Dave Grohl, impressed Novoselic and Cobain. When Scream unexpectedly disbanded, Grohl contacted Novoselic, made his way to Seattle, and was soon invited to join the band. Novoselic said in retrospect that when Grohl joined the band, everything \"fell into place\".\n\nMeanwhile Cobain was writing a number of new songs. At the time Cobain was listening to bands like R.E.M., The Smithereens, and the Pixies. Feeling disillusioned by the heavy detuned rock popular in the Seattle grunge scene which Sub Pop had built its image upon, Cobain—inspired by his contemporary listening habits—began writing songs that were more melodic. A key development was the single \"Sliver\", released on Sub Pop in 1990 (before Grohl joined the band), which Cobain said \"was like a statement in a way. I had to write a pop song and release it on a single to prepare people for the next record. I wanted to write more songs like that.\" Grohl said that the band at that point often made the analogy of likening their music to children's music, in that the band tried to make its songs as simple as possible.\n\nBy the start of the 1990s, Sub Pop was experiencing financial difficulties. With rumors that Sub Pop would sign up as a subsidiary for a major label, the band decided to \"cut out the middleman\" and start to look for a major label. A number of labels courted the band, but Nirvana ultimately signed with Geffen Records imprint DGC Records based upon the recommendation of its management, who also managed the band's idols (and recent Geffen signings) Sonic Youth, and Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, Nirvana began planning its second album for Sub Pop, tentatively titled Sheep. For the album, Sub Pop head Bruce Pavitt suggested Butch Vig as a potential producer. Nirvana particularly liked Vig's work with Killdozer and called Vig up to tell him, \"We want to sound as heavy as that record.\" In April 1990, the band traveled out to Vig's Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin to begin work on the album. Most of the basic song arrangements were completed by that time, but Cobain was still working on lyrics and the band was unsure of which songs to record. Ultimately, eight songs were recorded: \"Immodium\" (later renamed \"Breed\"), \"Dive\" (later released as the B-side to \"Sliver\"), \"In Bloom\", \"Pay to Play\" (eventually renamed \"Stay Away\" and given a new set of lyrics), \"Sappy\", \"Lithium\", \"Here She Comes Now\" (released on Velvet Underground Tribute Album: Heaven and Hell Volume 1), and \"Polly\". The band had planned to record more tracks, but Cobain blew his voice out on \"Lithium\", forcing them to shut down recording. Vig was told that the band would come back to record more songs, but the producer did not hear anything for a while. Instead, the band used the sessions as a demo tape to shop for a new label. Within a few months, the tape was circulating amongst major labels, creating a buzz around the group.\n\nAfter signing to Geffen, a number of producers for the album were suggested, including Scott Litt, David Briggs, and Don Dixon, but Nirvana held out for Vig. Novoselic noted in 2001 that the band was already nervous about recording on a major label, since the producers suggested wanted percentage points for the album, and they optioned for Vig, with whom they felt comfortable collaborating. Afforded a budget of $65,000, Nirvana recorded Nevermind at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, California in May and June 1991. Nirvana was originally set to record the album during March and April 1991, but the date kept getting pushed back in spite of the band's anxiousness to begin the sessions. To pay gas money to get to Los Angeles, Nirvana played a show where they played \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" for the first time. The band sent Vig some rehearsal tapes prior to the sessions that featured songs recorded previously at Smart Studios, along with some new ones including \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" and \"Come as You Are\".\n\nWhen the group arrived in California, Nirvana did a few days of pre-production where the band and Vig tightened up some of the song arrangements. The only recording carried over from the Smart Studios sessions was the song \"Polly\", which included cymbal crashes performed by Chad Channing. Once recording commenced, the band worked eight to ten hours a day. The band members tended to take two or three tries at instrumental takes; if the takes weren't satisfactory at that point, they would move on to something else. The group had rehearsed the songs so much before recording started that often only a few takes were needed. Novoselic and Grohl finished their bass and drum tracks in a matter of days, but Cobain had to work longer on guitar overdubs, singing, and particularly lyrics (which sometimes were finished mere minutes before recording). Cobain's phrasing was so consistent on various takes that Vig would mix the takes together to create overdubs. Vig says that he often had to trick Cobain into recording additional takes for overdubs since the singer was averse to performing multiple takes. In particular, Vig convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on the song \"In Bloom\" by telling him \"John Lennon did it.\" While the sessions went well generally, Vig said Cobain would become moody and difficult at times: \"He'd be great for an hour, and then he'd sit in a corner and say nothing for an hour.\"\n\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, Vig and the band set out to mix the album. However, after a few days, both Vig and the band members realized that they were unhappy with how the mixes were turning out. As a result, they decided to call in someone else to oversee the mixing, with Geffen Records imprint DGC supplying a list of possible options. The list contained several familiar names, including Scott Litt (known for his work with R.E.M.) and Ed Stasium (known for his work with The Smithereens). However, Cobain feared that bringing in known mixers would result in the album sounding like the work of those bands. Instead, Cobain chose Andy Wallace (who had co-produced Slayer's 1990 album Seasons in the Abyss) from the bottom of the list. Novoselic recalled, \"We said, 'right on,' because those Slayer records were so heavy.\" Wallace ran the songs through various special effects boxes and tweaked the drum sounds, completing about one mix per day. Both Wallace and Vig noted years later that upon hearing Wallace's work the band loved the mixes. After the album's release members of Nirvana expressed dissatisfaction with the polished sound the mixer had given Nevermind. Cobain said in Come as You Are, \"Looking back on the production of Nevermind, I'm embarrassed by it now. It's closer to a Mötley Crüe record than it is a punk rock record.\"\n\nNevermind was mastered on the afternoon of August 2 in The Mastering Lab in Hollywood, California. Howie Weinberg started working alone when no one else showed up at the appointed time in the studio; by the time Nirvana, Andy Wallace, and Gary Gersh arrived, Weinberg had mastered most of the album. One of the songs mastered at the session, a hidden track called \"Endless, Nameless\" intended to appear at the end of \"Something in the Way\", was accidentally left off initial pressings of the album. Weinberg recalled, \"In the beginning, it was kind of a verbal thing to put that track at the end. Maybe I misconstrued their instructions, so you can call it my mistake if you want. Maybe I didn't write it down when Nirvana or the record company said to do it. So, when they pressed the first twenty thousand or so CDs, albums, and cassettes, it wasn't on there.\" When the band discovered the song's omission after listening to its copy of the album, Cobain called Weinberg and demanded he rectify the mistake. Weinberg complied and added about ten minutes of silence between the end of \"Something in the Way\" and the start of the hidden track on future pressings of the album.\n\nNevermind was released on September 24, 1991. American record stores received an initial shipment of 46,251 copies, while 35,000 copies were shipped in the United Kingdom, where Bleach had been successful. The lead single \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" had been released on September 10 with the intention of being a base-building cut among alternative rock fans, while the next single \"Come As You Are\" would be the song that would possibly garner more attention. The band set out on a short American tour four days before the release date to support the album. Geffen Records hoped that Nevermind would sell around 250,000 copies, which was the same level the record company had achieved with Sonic Youth's Geffen debut Goo. The best estimate was that if all involved worked hard, the record could possibly be certified Gold by September 1992.\n\nThe album debuted on the Billboard 200 at position 144, which was high enough for the album to top the Heatseekers chart as well. Geffen shipped about half of the initial US pressing to the American Northwest, where it sold out quickly and was unavailable for days. Geffen reputedly put production of all other albums on hold in order to fulfill demand in the region. Nevermind was already selling well but, over the next few months, the momentum increased significantly as \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" unexpectedly became more and more popular. The song's video had received a world premiere on MTV's late night alternative show 120 Minutes but it soon proved so popular that the channel began playing it during the day. The record was soon certified gold, but the band was relatively uninterested in the achievement. Novoselic recalled, \"Yeah I was happy about it. It was pretty cool. It was kind of neat. But I don't give a shit about some kind of achievement like that. It's cool—I guess.\"\n\nAs the band set out for their European tour at the start of November 1991, Nevermind entered the Billboard Top 40 for the first time at number 35. By this point, \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" had become a genuine hit and the album was selling so fast none of Geffen's marketing strategies aimed at different sales levels could be enacted. Geffen president Ed Rosenblatt told The New York Times, \"We didn't do anything. It was just one of those 'Get out of the way and duck' records.\" Nirvana found as they toured Europe during the end of 1991 that the shows were dangerously oversold, television crews became a constant presence onstage, and \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" was almost omnipresent on radio and music television.\n\nNevermind became Nirvana's first number one album on January 11, 1992, replacing Michael Jackson at the top of the Billboard charts. By this time, Nevermind was selling approximately 300,000 copies a week. \"Come As You Are\" was finally released as the second single in March 1992; it peaked at number 32 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. Two more singles, \"Lithium\" and \"In Bloom\", were released from the album.\n\nNevermind was certified Gold and Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America in November 1991, and was certified Diamond in March 1999. It was also certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000 units) by the Canadian Recording Industry Association in March 2001. In 1996, Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released Nevermind on vinyl as part of its ANADISQ 200 series, and as a 24-carat gold CD. The CD pressings included \"Endless, Nameless\". The LP version sold out quickly of its limited pressing, but the CD edition stayed in print.\n\nUpon the album's release, several mainstream newspapers and magazines gave Nevermind positive reviews. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times wrote, \"With 'Nevermind,' Nirvana has certainly succeeded. There are enough intriguing textures, mood shifts, instrumental snippets and inventive word plays to provide for hours of entertainment.\" Schoemer concluded, \"'Nevermind' is more sophisticated and carefully produced than anything peer bands like Dinosaur Jr. and Mudhoney have yet offered.\" Entertainment Weekly gave Nevermind an A– rating, and reviewer David Browne argued that on Nevermind Nirvana \"never entertain the notion\" of wanting to sound \"normal,\" compared to other contemporary alternative bands. Concluding his very enthusiastic review for the British Melody Maker, Everett True wrote that \"When Nirvana released Bleach all those years ago, the more sussed among us figured they had the potential to make an album that would blow every other contender away. My God have they proved us right.\"\n\nRolling Stone gave the album three out of five stars; reviewer Ira Robbins wrote, \"If Nirvana isn't onto anything altogether new, Nevermind does possess the songs, character and confident spirit to be much more than a reformulation of college radio's high-octane hits.\" The Boston Globe was less enthusiastic about the album; reviewer Steve Morse wrote, \"Most of Nevermind is packed with generic punk-pop that had been done by countless acts from Iggy Pop to the Red Hot Chili Peppers,\" and added \"the band has little or nothing to say, settling for moronic ramblings by singer-lyricist Cobain.\"\n\nNevermind was voted as the best album of the year in The Village Voice Pazz & Jop critics' poll; \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\" also topped the single of the year and video of the year polls. Nevermind topped the poll by a large majority, and Village Voice critic Robert Christgau wrote in his companion piece to the poll, \"As a modest pop surprise they might have scored a modest victory, like De La Soul in 1990. Instead, their multi-platinum takeover constituted the first full-scale public validation of the Amerindie values—the noise, the toons, the 'tude—the radder half of the Pazz & Jop poll electorate came up on.\"\n\nCobain, Nirvana's main songwriter, fashioned chord sequences that were based mainly around power chords and wrote songs that combined pop hooks with dissonant guitar rhythms. His aim for Nevermind's material was to sound like the \"Bay City Rollers getting molested by Black Flag\". Many of the songs on Nevermind feature shifts in dynamics, where the band changes from quiet verses to loud choruses. Dave Grohl said this approach originated during a four-month period prior to the recording of the album, where the band would experiment with extreme dynamics during regular jam sessions.\n\nGuitar World wrote, \"Kurt Cobain's guitar sound on Nirvana's Nevermind set the tone for Nineties rock music.\" On Nevermind, Cobain played a 1960s Fender Mustang, a Fender Jaguar with DiMarzio pickups, and a few Fender Stratocasters with humbucker bridge pickups. The guitarist used distortion and chorus pedals as his main effects, the latter used to generate a \"watery\" sound on \"Come as You Are\" and the pre-choruses of \"Smells Like Teen Spirit\". Krist Novoselic tuned down his bass guitar one and a half steps to D flat \"to get this fat-ass sound\".\n\nGrohl said that Cobain told him, \"Music comes first, lyrics come second,\" and Grohl believes that above all Cobain focused on the melodies of his songs. Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain's phrasing on the album is often difficult to understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, \"Even though you couldn't quite tell what he was singing about, you knew it was intense as hell.\" Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing \"Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?\"\n\nCharles R. Cross asserted in his 2001 biography of Kurt Cobain, Heavier Than Heaven, that many of the songs written for Nevermind were about Cobain's dysfunctional relationship with Tobi Vail. After the relationship ended, Cobain began writing and painting violent scenes, many of which revealed hatred for himself and others. Songs written during this period were less violent, but still reflected anger absent from Cobain's earlier songs. Cross wrote \"In the four months following their break-up, Kurt would write a half dozen of his most memorable songs, all of them about Tobi Vail\". \"Drain You\" begins with the line \"One baby to another said 'I'm lucky to have met you'\", quoting what Vail had once told Cobain, and the line \"It is now my duty to completely drain you\" refers to the power Vail had over Kurt in their relationship. According to Novoselic, \"'Lounge Act' is about Tobi\", and the song contains the line \"I'll arrest myself, I'll wear a shield\", referring to Cobain having the K Records logo tattooed on his arm to impress Vail. Though \"Lithium\" had been written before Cobain knew Vail, the lyrics of the song were changed to reference her. Cobain also said in an interview with Musician that \"some of my very personal experiences, like breaking up with girlfriends and having bad relationships, feeling that death void that the person in the song is feeling–very lonely, sick.\"\n\nThe album's tentative title Sheep was something Cobain created as an inside joke towards the people he expected to buy the record. He wrote a fake ad for Sheep in his journal that read \"Because you want to not; because everyone else is.\" Novoselic said the inspiration for the title was the band's cynicism about the public's reaction to Operation Desert Storm. As recording sessions for the album were completed, Cobain grew tired of the title and suggested to Novoselic that the new album be named Nevermind. Cobain liked the title because it was a metaphor for his attitude on life, and because it was grammatically incorrect.\n\nThe Nevermind album cover shows a baby swimming toward a US dollar bill on a fishhook. According to Cobain, he conceived the idea while watching a television program on water births with Grohl. Cobain mentioned it to Geffen's art director Robert Fisher. Fisher found some stock footage of underwater births but they were too graphic for the record company. Also, the stock house that controlled the photo of a swimming baby that they subsequently settled on wanted $7,500 a year for its use, so instead Fisher sent a photographer to a pool for babies to take pictures. Five shots resulted and the band settled on the image of a three-month-old infant named Spencer Elden, the son of the photographer's friend Rick Elden. However, there was some concern because Elden's penis was visible in the image. Geffen prepared an alternate cover without the penis, as they were afraid that it would offend people, but relented when Cobain made it clear that the only compromise he would accept was a sticker covering the penis that would say, \"If you're offended by this, you must be a closet pedophile.\"\n\nThe back cover of the album features a photograph of a rubber monkey in front of a collage created by Cobain. The collage features photos of raw beef from a supermarket advertisement, images from Dante's Inferno, and pictures of diseased vaginas from Cobain's collection of medical photos. Cobain noted, \"If you look real close, there is a picture of Kiss in the back standing on a slab of beef.\" The album's liner notes contain no complete song lyrics; instead, the liner contains random song lyrics and unused lyrical fragments that Cobain arranged into a poem.\n\nNevermind not only popularized the Seattle grunge movement, but also brought alternative rock as a whole into the mainstream, establishing its commercial and cultural viability. Nevermind's success surprised Nirvana's contemporaries, who felt dwarfed by its impact. Fugazi's Guy Picciotto later commented: \"It was like our record could have been a hobo pissing in the forest for the amount of impact it had. It felt like we were playing ukuleles all of a sudden because of the disparity of the impact of what they did\". In 1992, Jon Pareles of The New York Times described that in the aftermath of the album's breakthrough, \"Suddenly, all bets are off. No one has the inside track on which of dozens, perhaps hundreds, of ornery, obstreperous, unkempt bands might next appeal to the mall-walking millions\". Record company executives offered large advances and record deals to bands, and previous strategies of building audiences for alternative rock bands had been replaced by the opportunity to achieve mainstream popularity quickly.\n\nMichael Azerrad argued in his Nirvana biography Come as You Are: The Story of Nirvana (1993) that Nevermind marked the emergence of a generation of music fans in their twenties in a climate dominated by the musical tastes of the baby boomer generation that preceded them. Azerrad wrote, \"Nevermind came along at exactly the right time. This was music by, for, and about a whole new group of young people who had been overlooked, ignored, or condescended to.\" Rolling Stone wrote in its entry for Nevermind on its 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, \"No album in recent history had such an overpowering impact on a generation—a nation of teens suddenly turned punk—and such a catastrophic effect on its main creator.\"\n\nNevermind has continued to garner critical praise since its release. The album was listed at number seventeen on Rolling Stone's list \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". Time placed Nevermind, which writer Josh Tyrangiel called \"the finest album of the 90s,\" on its 2006 list of \"The All-TIME 100 Albums.\" Pitchfork named the album the sixth best of the decade, noting that \"anyone who hates this record today is just trying to be cool, and needs to be trying harder.\" In 2005, the Library of Congress added Nevermind to the National Recording Registry, which collects \"culturally, historically or aesthetically important\" sound recordings from the 20th century. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/Nevermind\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, and has become the most successful posthumous Nirvana release, selling five million copies in America by 1997. It was hailed by critics as proof the band was able to transcend the grunge sound they were commonly associated with. MTV Unplugged in New York includes two songs which were not aired on the original television broadcast of the concert: \"Something in the Way\" and \"Oh, Me.\" The album won a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1996. The performance received a DVD release in 2007. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/MTV+Unplugged+in+New+York\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following the success of the group's 1991 breakthrough album Nevermind, Nirvana sought to avoid that album's polished production and hired recording engineer Steve Albini to produce the record. The band recorded In Utero with Albini in two weeks in February 1993, capturing an abrasive and naturalistic sound for the record. While some of the songs had been written years prior, the lyrics largely dealt with frontman Kurt Cobain's reflections on his newfound fame and recent personal troubles, incorporating imagery of sickness and disease.\n\nSoon after recording was completed, controversy erupted as news reports stated that DGC did not like the band's sessions with Albini and refused to release the album, deeming it uncommercial. Nirvana denied the statements but were also not fully satisfied with the sound Albini captured. The band ultimately made some minor changes to the album's sound and hired producer Scott Litt to mix the singles \"Heart-Shaped Box\" and \"All Apologies\". Upon its release, \"In Utero\" debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and received critical acclaim as a drastic departure from \"Nevermind\". The record has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, and has sold over four million copies in the United States.\n\nTo avoid over-hyping the album, DGC Records took a low-key approach to promoting \"In Utero\"; the company's head of marketing told Billboard before the album's release that the label was taking a promotional strategy similar to that of \"Nevermind\", and explained that the label would \"set things up, duck, and get out of the way\". The label aimed its promotion at alternative markets and press, and released the album on vinyl record as part of this strategy. In contrast to the previous album, the label did not release any of In Utero's singles commercially in the United States. DGC sent promo copies of the album's first single \"Heart-Shaped Box\" to American college, modern rock, and album-oriented rock radio stations in early September, but the label did not target Top 40 radio. Despite the label's promotion, the band was convinced that \"In Utero\" would not be as successful as \"Nevermind\". Cobain told Jim DeRogatis, \"We're certain that we won't sell a quarter as much, and we're totally comfortable with that because we like this record so much.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was released on September 13, 1993 in the United Kingdom, and on September 14 in the United States; it was initially only available in vinyl record and cassette tape formats, with the American vinyl pressing limited to 25,000 copies. Although the album was issued on compact disc in the UK on September 14, a full domestic release did not occur until September 21. \"In Utero\" debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart, selling 180,000 copies in its first week of release. Meanwhile, retail chain stores Walmart and K-Mart refused to sell the album. According to The New York Times, Wal-Mart claimed it did not carry the album due to lack of consumer demand, while Kmart representatives explained that the album \"didn't fit within our merchandise mix\". In truth, both chains feared that customers would be offended by the artwork on the album's back cover. DGC issued a new version of the album with reworked packaging to the stores in March 1994. This version featured edited album artwork, and listed the name of \"Rape Me\" as \"Waif Me\". A spokesperson for Nirvana explained that the band decided to edit the packaging because as kids Cobain and Novoselic were only able to buy music from the two chain stores; as a result they \"really want to make their music available to kids who don't have the opportunity to go to mom-and-pop stores\".\n\n\"In Utero\" received acclaim from critics. Time's Christopher John Farley stated in his review of the album, \"Despite the fears of some alternative-music fans, Nirvana hasn't gone mainstream, though this potent new album may once again force the mainstream to go Nirvana.\" Rolling Stone reviewer David Fricke wrote, \"In Utero is a lot of things – brilliant, corrosive, enraged and thoughtful, most of them all at once. But more than anything, it's a triumph of the will.\" Entertainment Weekly reviewer David Browne (who gave the album a rating of B+) commented \"Kurt Cobain hates it all\", and noted that the sentiment pervades the record. Browne argued, \"The music is often mesmerizing, cathartic rock & roll, but it is rock & roll without release, because the band is suspicious of the old-school rock cliches such a release would evoke.\" NME gave the album an eight out of ten rating. However, reviewer John Mulvey had doubts about the record; he concluded, \"As a document of a mind in flux — dithering, dissatisfied, unable to come to terms with sanity — Kurt should be proud of . As a follow-up to one of the best records of the past ten years it just isn't quite there.\" Ben Thompson of The Independent commented that in spite of the album's more abrasive songs, \"In Utero is beautiful far more often than it is ugly\", and added, \"Nirvana have wisely neglected to make the unlistenable punk-rock nightmare they threatened us with.\" Critics ranked \"In Utero\" as one of the best releases of the year. It placed first and second in the album categories of the Rolling Stone and Village Voice Pazz & Jop year-end critics' polls, respectively. Additionally, The New York Times included it on its list of the top ten albums of the year. The album was nominated for Best Alternative Music Album at the 1994 Grammy Awards.\n\nThat October, Nirvana embarked on its first American tour in two years to promote the album. A second single, a split release that featured \"All Apologies\" and \"Rape Me\", was issued in December in the United Kingdom. The band began a six-week European leg of the tour in February 1994, but it was cancelled after Cobain suffered a drug overdose in Rome on March 6. Cobain agreed to enter drug rehabilitation, but the singer went missing soon afterwards, and on April 8 he was found dead in his Seattle home as the result of suicide by a shotgun blast. The intended third single from \"In Utero\", \"Pennyroyal Tea\", was cancelled in the wake of Cobain's death and the subsequent dissolution of Nirvana; limited promotional copies were released in Britain. Three days after Cobain's body was discovered, \"In Utero\" moved back up the Billboard charts, from number 72 to number 27.\n\nIn the ensuing years, \"In Utero\" has continued to perform commercially and gather critical praise. In a 2003 Guitar World article that commemorated the tenth anniversary of the album's release, Cobain biographer Charles R. Cross argued that \"In Utero\" was \"a far better record  and one that only 10 years later seems to be an influential seed spreader, judging by current bands. If it is possible for an album that sold four million copies to be overlooked, or underappreciated, then \"In Utero\" is that lost pearl.\" That same year, Pitchfork Media placed In Utero at number 13 on its list of the 100 best albums of the 1990s, and Rolling Stone ranked it at number 439 on its list \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2004 Blender ranked it at number 94 in its \"100 Greatest American Albums of All Time\" list, while in 2005, Spin placed it at number 51 on its \"100 Greatest Albums 1985-2005\" retrospective. \"In Utero\" has been certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for shipments of over five million units, and has sold a total of four million copies in the United States, according to Nielsen SoundScan. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nirvana/In+Utero\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album features the singles \"Feel Good Inc.\", \"DARE\", \"Dirty Harry\" and \"Kids with Guns\" / \"El Mañana\".\n\nDemon Days was first mentioned in articles detailing the reopening of Gorillaz' website in early December 2004. Initially, a March or April 2005 release date was announced, but it was later pushed back. In an article for Q Magazine in February 2005 it was reported that the album was to be titled \"We Are Happy Landfill\". Another early title was reported to be \"Reject False Icons\", which is also the title of Gorillaz' culture jamming project.\n\nIn January 2005 a promo for the song \"Dirty Harry\" was released as a white label 12\" and an exclusive video was released online entitled \"Rock It\". It was later reported that the track would not appear on the album, although it later appeared on \"D-Sides\", a collection of remixes, rare songs and B-sides released in November 2007.\n\nThe album's lead single \"Feel Good Inc.\" became Gorillaz' biggest hit (UK #2, US #14, US-Modern Rock #1) at the time. The album's second single, \"DARE\" featuring Shaun Ryder, became a big hit as well, giving the band their first #1 single in the UK.\n\nThe album cover is a reference to \"Let It Be\" by The Beatles and resembles the \"Blur: The Best Of\" artwork, the greatest hits album by Albarn's first band Blur.\n\nA limited edition of the album was released in a special digipak gatefold, allowing the owner to choose which band member is on the cover. It also contains an exclusive booklet, with lyrics and illustrations for each song, a DVD containing the video (with audio commentary), an animatic for the music video \"Feel Good Inc.\", short animated films featuring the band, an exclusive audio track titled \"The Swagga\" and online access to exclusive sections of the band's website, with various wallpapers and screensavers, as well as a crowbar, facilitating the opening of a locked cupboard in the kitchen on Gorillaz.com in order to download the song \"Happy Landfill\".\n\nThe phrase 'Reject False Icons' was first mentioned on 24 November 2004 on a Gorillaz mail out to fans. On 8 December, the Gorillaz website was re-opened with a brand new music video, \"Rock It\", which has the saying \"Reject False Icons\" at the end. On 19 December the 'Reject False Icons' campaign kicked off with the launch of rejectfalseicons.com. Fans could submit their photos of ways to spread the message by using graffiti or by sticking 'Reject False Icons' stickers that were available for a limited period from the site and from selected record shops in the UK. It was first Respect False Icons, but Albarn changed it to Reject False Icons. Noodle said it is both 'Respect' and 'Reject'.\n\nIn December 2004, the Gorillaz launched their own talent contest, Search for a Star, to find an artist to collaborate with. There were on average over 100 entries per week whittled down to around 10 to be put forward for the public vote. The 200+ entries were viewed over a million times. A gallery room was added to Kong Studios which displayed all of the entries. Originally, Gorillaz' competition, was initially run to pick just one winner from entries submitted to Gorillaz.com. However, at the end of the competition, it was announced that two further entries—one from the submitted images, and one from the submitted audio files—would be chosen by online vote.\n\nThe winners for each entries are as followed:\n\nVideo: \"Table Manners\" by Carlos \"Sourbee\" Sowerby \nAudio: \"Indian Dance\" by Danny \"Asidus\" Gonzalez \nImage: \"2D and Paula\" by Irina \"Schneeflocke\" Bolshakova ( www.schneef.com ) \nAll three collaborated on the fourth single release of Phase Two, \"Kids With Guns\" / \"El Mañana\".

It features guest appearances by several artists, including Snoop Dogg, Gruff Rhys, Bobby Womack, Mos Def, Lou Reed, Mick Jones, and the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble. Primarily a pop  album, \"Plastic Beach\" contains lyrics concerning consumerism and ecology-related themes.\n\nThe album has produced three singles, \"Stylo\", \"Superfast Jellyfish\", and \"On Melancholy Hill\".\n\nCreators of Gorillaz, musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett, began working on a new Gorillaz project in November 2007 called Carousel, which evolved into Plastic Beach, the group's third studio album.  In the November 2007 issue of Q, when asked what his top priority for 2008 was, Damon Albarn replied \"Well, I'm doing the next Gorillaz thing, but it won't be called Gorillaz.\"  In the February 2008 Gorillaz-Unofficial interview, Jamie Hewlett elaborated on this, saying \"I think the idea behind it is that it's like how The Who presented their movies – Tommy and Quadrophenia and so on. Those were presented as by 'The Who' even though none of the members of the band were in the movies. I don't think anyone from The Who was in Quadrophenia. But it's the same people working on it, that's the principle.\"  In a July 2008 interview with The Observer he also said, \"Gorillaz now to us is not like four animated characters any more — it's more like an organisation of people doing new projects.  That's my ideal model — Gorillaz is a group of people who gave you this, and now want to give you new stuff.\"\n\nIn the Observer interview, Hewlett said that there is \"a new project which Damon and I are working on now, called Carousel, which is even bigger and more difficult than Monkey, and it isn't going to fit anywhere and no one's going to like it, ha ha ha! We've started work — I've done a lot of visuals and Damon's done a lot of music but we haven't figured out how they're going to fit together. I can't say much about it yet but it's sort of like a film, but not with one narrative story. There's many stories, told around a bigger story, set to music, and done in live action, animation, all different styles, well... originally it was a film but now we think it's a film and it's a stage thing as well and... look, it's basically us doing what the fuck we want without worrying about whether it's for a record company or a film company or whatever. So I'm not sure how it'll pan out, or even if it will happen. But Damon's written around 70 songs for it, and I've got great plans for the visuals, but right now, at this moment, it's still just a really good idea.\" Carousel was to be about the mystical aspects of Britain. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gorillaz/Plastic+Beach\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following the debut releases of Rock and Roll Night Club and 2 in 2012 and the extensive touring for both releases in 2013, DeMarco worked on material for his next album at his Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment in Brooklyn. Salad Days garnered acclaim from critics, and debuted at number 30 on the Billboard 200. The album spawned two singles: Passing Out Pieces and Brother. To promote the album, DeMarco went on a tour that spanned across North America, South America and Europe.\n\nOn the sound of Salad Days, DeMarco said: \"I didn't want to freak anybody out with a huge sound change. I wanted to transition without changing the vibe too much. The mood for Salad Days is, 'Fuck man! I was just on tour for a year and a half and I'm tired!'\"\n\nRegarding the album's lyrical content, DeMarco consciously decided to write a more personal record than its predecessor, 2 (2012), stating there wouldn't be any songs about \"absolutely nothing\", and that he \"needed to get this shit out. Three of the album's tracks focus upon his long-term girlfriend Kiera McNally, with  Let My Baby Stay referencing the couple's decision to move from Montreal, Canada to Brooklyn.\n\nThe track Chamber of Reflection references a freemasonry concept, which DeMarco subsequently likened to his home studio: \"It's a room people go into before you're initiated into freemasonry. It's like a meditation room, and they lock you in there for a period of time. The purpose is to reflect on what you've done in your life already and move on from it. I think that's what I did in  right here. It was actually therapeutic. I feel a little enlightened, a little less heavy. It's tight\".\n\nUpon its release, Salad Days was met with critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 82 out of 100 based on 27 reviews, which indicates \"universal acclaim\". Marc Hogan of Pitchfork stated that Salad Days \"isn't a departure from its predecessor so much as a richer, increasingly assured refinement\" Fred Thomas of AllMusic wrote that DeMarco showcases \"a streamlined picture of his musical development\", and that \"with more memorable tracks and a slightly more accessible feel, the album is less distracted and more tuneful than before without losing any of the freewheeling spirit that made his songs and persona so attractive in the first place\". Alex Denney of NME concluded that DeMarco had \"simply dialled down the quirk and written his best record yet\".\n\nNME named Salad Days the second best album of 2014, while the tracks Chamber of Reflection and Passing Out Pieces placed at numbers 10 and 26 respectively on their list of the top 50 tracks of 2014. Salad Days was a shortlisted nominee for the 2014 Polaris Music Prize. The album was the most played record across Canadian community radio in April 2014 and the second most played album of 2014, behind Chad VanGaalen's  Shrink Dust, as tracked by the National Campus and Community Radio Association's national charts, !earshot. In October 2019, Salad Days placed at no. 21 on Happy Mag's list of \"The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+DeMarco/Salad+Days\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album received generally positive reviews from critics and charted at number two on the US Billboard 200.\n\nMiller began working on The Divine Feminine immediately after completing his previous studio album GO:OD AM, wanting to explore the emotion of love. He initially intended The Divine Feminine to be an EP, but changed it to a full-length album to allow himself to be more vulnerable. According to Miller, the album was not just about romantic love, but also about learning from women throughout his life and what those experiences meant to him. In May 2018, singer Ariana Grande, Miller's girlfriend at the time of the album's release, denied a claim that the entire album was about her, but said the track \"Cinderella\" was.\n\nMiller announced The Divine Feminine Tour on August 24, 2016. The tour consisted of 43 shows across North America, beginning in Pittsburgh on September 18, 2016, and ending in Baltimore on December 18, 2016.\n\nIn the United States, The Divine Feminine debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, with 48,000 album-equivalent units, 32,000 of which were from traditional album sales.\n\nThe Divine Feminine earned 12,000 units in the week following Miller's death on September 7, 2018, allowing the album to re-enter the Billboard 200 at number 50. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller/The+Divine+Feminine\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was being worked on by Miller before his death in 2018, and was released posthumously on January 17, 2020, by Warner Records. Production was completed by Jon Brion.\n\nCircles was supported by two singles: \"Good News\" and \"Blue World\". The album received widespread acclaim from critics and debuted at number three on the US Billboard 200, earning 164,000 album-equivalent units during its first week, making it Miller's biggest week for an album.\n\nAt the time of his death, Miller was \"well into\" the recording process of Circles. It was intended to be a companion album to \"Swimming\", with \"two different styles complementing each other, completing a circle\" and the concept being \"swimming in circles\". Brion, who worked with Miller on the album, completed production \"based on his time and conversations\" with Miller. \"Swimming\" and \"Circles\" were planned to be the first two instalments in a trilogy of albums, where the last piece would have been \"a pure hip-hop record\", as described by Brion.\n\nCircles was announced by Miller's family via a note on his Instagram account on January 8, 2020. It was released by Warner Records on January 17, 2020.\n\nThe lead single, \"Good News\", was released on January 9, 2020, alongside an accompanying music video directed by Anthony Gaddis and Eric Tilford. The video features imagery of Miller in an abstract world with colorful animated landscapes. The remaining tracks on the album were also released with music videos of a similar style on January 17, 2020. \"Good News\" debuted at number 17 on US Billboard Hot 100, surpassing \"Self Care\" (2018; number 33) as his highest-charting song as lead artist. \"Blue World\" was sent to US rhythmic contemporary radio on February 4, 2020, as the album's second single. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mac+Miller/Circles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "The Eminem Show is the fourth studio album by American rapper  Eminem. After it had originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002, the album was released on May 26, 2002, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records due to pirating and bootlegging of it. The album saw  Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass, and Dr. Dre being the album's executive producers. It features guest appearances from Obie Trice, D12, Dr. Dre, Nate Dogg, Dina Rae, and  Eminem's daughter Hailie Jade Scott-Mathers.\n\nThe album incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than  Eminem's previous albums, and its themes are predominantly based on  Eminem's prominence in hip-hop culture, as well as his ambivalent thoughts about fame. The album also features political commentary on the United States, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the War on terror, President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney, and Tipper Gore. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as  Eminem's most personal album at the time and a step back from the Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nWidely considered the most anticipated album of 2002, The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and stood there for six non-consecutive weeks. It sold over 1.3 million copies in its second week in the US, where it registered a full week of sales. It also topped the UK Albums Chart for five consecutive weeks. It produced four commercially successful singles, \"Without Me\", \"Cleanin' Out My Closet\", \"Superman\", and \"Sing for the Moment\". The album was met with positive critical reviews, with praise directed at Eminem's mature, introspective lyricism and the album's experimental production.\n\nThe Eminem Show was both the best-selling album of 2002 in the United States and the best-selling album worldwide of 2002. It was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its worldwide sales of over 27 million copies make it one of the best-selling albums of all time and the third best-selling album of the 21st century. At the 2003 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album, while \"Without Me\" won Best Music Video. Blender, Muzik and LAUNCH named it the best album of 2002, and several publications named it among the best albums of the 2000s decade.\n\nBackground\n\nSpeaking to Spin, Eminem said, \"Eventually, I might need some drama in my life to inspire me  With The Marshall Mathers LP, everything that everybody was saying–I took that, and it was my ammo. And then when shit died down a little bit, I had other turmoil in my personal life, so that was what I was able to dump out on The Eminem Show. Now, I just gotta wait for the next phase of my life. But something always seems to happen, man; something's always gotta be fucking turbulent.\"\n\nEminem cited that the inspiration for the album was taken from the Peter Weir-directed 1998 science fiction comedy-drama film The Truman Show. Jim Carrey starred in the film as the lead character Truman Burbank, a man who unwittingly lives inside a TV show, where his life is broadcast to viewers around the world. Eminem spoke on the film's influence, saying, \"My life felt like it was becoming a circus around that time, and I felt like I was always being watched  Basically, Jim Carrey wrote my album.\n\nRecording\n\nSpeaking with Rolling Stone in 2002, Eminem said \"\"Sing for the Moment\" was the first song I wrote for the album; \"Cleanin Out My Closet\" was the second. I had the line in \"Cleanin Out My Closet\" — \"I'd like to welcome y'all out to The Eminem Show\" — and it was just a line, but I sat back and I was like, \"My life is really like a fucking show.\" I have songs on the album that I wrote when I was in that shit last year, with a possible jail sentence hangin' over my head and all the emotions going through the divorce. I went through a lot of shit last year  that I resolved at the same time, all in the same year. And, yeah, that's when half of the album was wrote.\n\nEminem had started recording the album around the same time he was filming 8 Mile. Production was used for both the soundtrack of the film and his album. The album also saw Eminem take a substantially more predominant production role; most of it was self-produced, with his longtime collaborator Jeff Bass co-producing several tracks (mainly the songs which eventually, became the released singles). Dr. Dre, in addition to being the album's executive producer, produced only three individual tracks: \"Business\", \"Say What You Say\", and \"My Dad's Gone Crazy\". Regarding his increase in producing, Eminem told Rolling Stone, \"I actually know how to program a drum machine now. It used to be so simple — just writing lyrics and raps, laying vocals and leaving the studio was great. But now that I'm so into producing, it's a fucking job.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nStylistically, The Eminem Show has a lighter tone than The Marshall Mathers LP and incorporates a heavier use of rap rock than Eminem's previous albums, featuring mixed guitar-driven melodies with hip hop rhythms. In an interview with British magazine The Face in April 2002, Eminem said that he treated the album like it was a rock record. He continued that he \"tried to get the best of both worlds\" on the album. Eminem spoke on specific rock influences, saying, \"I listened to a lot of '70s rock growing up, when I was real little. When I go back and listen to them songs, like Led Zeppelin or Aerosmith, Jimi Hendrix...'70s rock had this incredible feel to it. Notably, \"Sing For The Moment\" contains a sample of Aerosmith's \"Dream On\" as well as a reinterpretation of its guitar solo. Another rock sample on the album is the kick-clap beat of \"'Till I Collapse\", which is an interpolation of the intro from Queen's \"We Will Rock You\".\n\nThe themes of The Eminem Show are predominantly based on Eminem's prominence in hip hop culture and the subsequent envy towards him, as well as his thoughts on his unexpected enormous success and its consequential negative effects on his life. The album also touches on Eminem's thoughts on themes surrounding American politics, including references to 9/11, Osama bin Laden, the war on terror President George W. Bush, Lynne Cheney and Tipper Gore. Speaking on his use of political commentary on the album, Eminem told Rolling Stone, \"You put your shit out there for the world to see and to judge, and whoever agrees with you agrees with you. Even my most die-hard fans don't agree with everything I say. These are my views, this is how I see it. You may have your own opinion, but you may not get to project it to the world like I do. Writing for Spin, rock critic Alan Light said that the album may have proved that Eminem is the most \"dexterous, vivid writer in pop music\". The album also sees Eminem dissing several artists, including Mariah Carey, Moby, Canibus and Limp Bizkit, while Dr. Dre disses Jermaine Dupri on the song \"Say What You Say\".\n\nLyrically, the album shows Eminem's personal and musical growth with there being a lack of misogyny and homophobia compared to The Marshall Mathers LP. Eminem told Spin, \"One of the frustrating things was people saying, 'He's got to cuss to sell records,'  That's why with this album, I toned it down a bit as far as shock value. I wanted to show that I'm a solid artist, and I'm here to stay. Due to its less satirical and shock factor lyrical approach, The Eminem Show was regarded as a departure from Eminem's previous albums. with it being more personal and reflective and a step back of the Slim Shady alter ego. Eminem said during an interview with MTV that he felt that The Eminem Show was his \"best record so far\". In 2006, Q said that Eminem's first two albums \"aired dirty laundry, then the world's most celebrated rapper  examined life in the hall of mirrors he'd built for himself.\n\nWith the release of The Eminem Show, Eminem was considered to be more socially acceptable: there were no protests over his lyrics, boycotts, and talk shows discussing his impact on America's youth. A columnist of The New York Observer wrote that Eminem had become a \"guilty pleasure\" for baby boomers, describing him as \"the most compelling figure to have emerged from popular music since the holy trinity of  Dylan,  Lennon, and  Jagger.\n\nCensored version\n\nThe \"clean version\" of The Eminem Show censors many more profanities and derogatory words than in clean versions of Eminem's previous albums, in which the words \"goddamn\", \"prick\", \"bastard\", \"piss\", \"bitch\", \"ass\", and \"shit\" were allowed. This album allowed no profanities, and the profanities were either muted, obscured by sound effects, or back-masked. In addition to this, entire sentences were sometimes removed from the censored version for being very sexually charged. The entire song \"Drips\" was removed in early clean versions and is heard only as four seconds of silence moving on to the next track, \"Without Me\". Later on, digital releases of the clean version removed \"Drips\" completely, moving the next 11 songs up on the tracklist. Some copies of the clean version, however, feature an edited version of \"Drips\".\n\nThere are some inconsistencies in clean version's censorship. In the skit \"The Kiss\", Eminem's shouting of the word \"motherfucker!\" is still audible in the censored version. In the track, \"Soldier\", which is a continuation of \"The Kiss\", the word \"bitch\" was used three times, and can be clearly heard once. \"Hailie's Song\" contains the back masked phrase \"want her\" which can be easily mistaken as \"abort her\" on both the explicit and clean versions. Also, in \"White America\", the word \"flag\" is back masked when he raps, \"To burn the flag and replace it with a parental advisory sticker\".\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Eminem Show was met with generally positive reviews upon release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 75, based on 20 reviews.\n\nAlex Needham of NME hailed The Eminem Show as a \"fantastic third album\" that \"is bigger, bolder and far more consistent than its predecessors\". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly felt the album's more personal lyrics \"succeed in fleshing out Eminem's complexities and contradictions\", nonetheless concluding that \"ike its predecessors, though, The Eminem Show is a testament to the skills of its star. The sludgy rapping of such guests as D12 only confirms Eminem's dizzying prowess, gob-spewing individuality, and wickedly prankish humor. Writing for Rolling Stone, Kris Ex argued that Eminem \"may have made the best rap rock album in history.\n\nSlant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani wrote that he \"peels back some of the bullshit façade and reveals a little bit of the real Marshall Mathers\" on an album that \"displays a—dare I say it?—more 'mature' Eminem. In his review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said the album \"proves Eminem is the gold standard in pop music in 2002, delivering stylish, catchy, dense, funny, political music that rarely panders\". Critic Robert Christgau wrote: \"I think it represents an articulate, coherent, formally appropriate response to Eminem's changing position and role, one that acknowledges the privileges and alienations that accrue to all fame as well as the resolution of Marshall Mathers's worst traumas and the specifics of his success.\n\nEdna Gundersen of USA Today wrote that Eminem is \"as good as he gets but in the end inflicts more damage on himself, hoisting The Eminem Show to a level of self-absorption rivaled only by Woody Allen\", and despite the presence of some mediocre tracks, he \"displays an admirable dexterity in blending invective and invention, even though his approach is more reactionary than revolutionary. Uncut wrote, \"Behind the hype and the swagger, he's still baring enough of his soul for The Eminem Show to be compelling theatre. Q was more mixed in its assessment, stating that as \"Eminem outgrows his old alter-id, so the obligatory pantomime villainy, skits and crass cameos by Shady Records signings become a hindrance. Marc L. Hill of PopMatters felt that the album lacked the shock factor of his previous albums and described it as \"a disappointing combination of promising musical experimentation and uninspired lyrics.\n\nOn June 3, 2002, Pitchfork Media's Ethan P. published a review of The Eminem Show which infamously consisted of a meandering stream of consciousness monologue. While giving it a 9.1/10, P. vulgarly and comedically criticized various aspects of the album, including its lead singles, its lyrics, and especially \"My Dad's Gone Crazy\", which he described as a \"saccharine-sweetened lemon incest gone faggy\". The review, making use of line breaks and written entirely in lowercase, referred in one section to \"the him fucking dre thing / dyeing your hair and wearing earrings thing from the aerosmith song / or hailie being 'the only lady he adores' / sleazy disco / little eric and erica / dre is batman and he's the burt ward robin / etc\". Despite its comedically self-referential sections, including a paragraph where P. states \"if you're reading this sentence then wow i really got an unedited review on pfork \", and several offhand remarks (\"yeah dude timbaland is biting aphex twins white ass too haha i dunno fuck it here are some more bullshit things about the actual record like right on schedule pfork review style\"), the review has remained on the Pitchfork website, and P.'s rating for The Eminem Show continues to be the publication's official rating of the album.\n\nBlender, Muzik and LAUNCH named The Eminem Show the best album of 2002. The album became Eminem's third to win the Grammy Award for Best Rap Album, while \"Without Me\" won Eminem his first Best Music Video award. The album swept the MTV Music Video Awards, winning four awards for Best Male Video, Video of the Year, Best Direction, and Best Rap Video. The album also won Best Album at the 2002 MTV Europe Music Awards, both Album of the Year and Top R&B/Hip Hop Album at the 2002 Billboard Music Awards, both Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Album at the 2003 American Music Awards, Best International Album at the 2003 Brit Awards, and International Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2003.\n\nReappraisal\n\nThe Eminem Show received critical praise by most music critics and is often debated as Eminem's most personal and best work. The album cemented Eminem's \"three-peat\" of classic hip hop albums, following the critical appraisal of The Slim Shady LP and The Marshall Mathers LP. In 2003, the album was ranked number 317 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, and was later ranked at number 84 on the same magazine's Best Albums of the 2000s Decade. In 2007, it was ranked number 63 by The National Association of Recording Merchandisers, in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in their list of the Definite 200 Albums of All Time. In 2012, Complex magazine deemed it a \"classic\" album that \"cemented Eminem's place as one of the most important figures in rap history\", and has included it on their list of 100 Best Albums of the Complex Decade, placing it at number 5, Following the 15th anniversary of the album, the Grammy Awards also described The Eminem Show as a \"classic album\". Popdose ranked the album at 79 on its Best Albums of the Decade list. In 2015, The Eminem Show was ranked number 56 on the Greatest of All Time Billboard 200 Albums.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Eminem Show was originally scheduled for release on June 4, 2002; however, pirated and bootlegged copies appeared online via peer-to-peer networks and began surfacing on the streets. It was provided by Rabid Neurosis (RNS), an MP3 warez release organisation who pirated the album twenty-five days prior to release. Radio show Opie and Anthony broadcast the entire album on May 17, 2002. Interscope decided to release the album earlier than planned, on May 28 to prevent bootlegging. However, many stores in the United States began selling it even earlier than the new release date on Sunday, May 26, and some put the album out as early as Friday. Promotional posters in stores read, \"America Couldn't Wait\". Due to the premature release by many retailers on a Sunday, the album had only one day of official sales for the chart week and was unavailable in Walmart stores during that period. The Eminem Show was Eminem's first album to include lyrics to all its songs inside the CD booklet. Additionally, the first 2,000,000 copies of the album shipped in the United States included a bonus DVD with an exclusive interview and live footage. A week before the album's release, it was the second-most played CD on computers, the highest ranking ever for an unreleased title. It was considered the most anticipated album of 2002.\n\nDespite the confusion over the exact release date, the album still managed to have a very successful debut on the charts. The Eminem Show debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, selling approximately 284,000 copies in its first day, marking the first time an album had topped the chart from only a day's sale. It sold 1,322,000 copies in the following week, its first full week of sales, then sold 809,000 copies in its third week and 529,562 copies in its fourth week to bring its four-week sales total to just under 3 million copies. The album sold 381,000 copies in its fifth week and topped the Billboard 200 for a fifth and final consecutive week. On March 7, 2011, the album was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipping 10 million copies, making it Eminem's second album to receive a Diamond certification in the United States. It has also achieved Diamond certification in Canada and Double Diamond in Australia.\n\nThe Eminem Show has sold 27 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and Eminem's best-selling album. It reached number one in 18 other countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. The album also spent five consecutive weeks at the top of the UK Albums Chart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Eminem+Show\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Recovery is the seventh studio album by American rapper  Eminem. It was released on June 18, 2010, by Aftermath Entertainment, Shady Records, and Interscope Records. It serves as the follow-up to  Eminem's sixth studio album Relapse. Originally planned to be released as Relapse 2, the album was renamed to Recovery when  Eminem found the album to be musically different from its predecessor.\n\nProduction of the album took place from 2009 to 2010 at several recording studios and was handled by various record producers, including Alex da Kid, Just Blaze, Boi-1da, Jim Jonsin, DJ Khalil, Mr. Porter, and Dr. Dre.  Eminem also collaborated with artists such as Pink, Lil Wayne, Slaughterhouse and Rihanna for the album. Recovery featured more introspective and emotional content than its predecessor and the theme of the album revolved around his positive changes, anxiety, and emotional drives.\n\nRecovery debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies. It also reached number one in 16 other countries. It spawned four singles; \"Not Afraid\", \"Love the Way You Lie\", \"No Love\", and \"Space Bound\", with the former two both reaching number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Recovery was the best-selling album worldwide and the best-selling album in the US of 2010. The album received generally positive reviews by critics and was regarded as an improvement to Relapse. To promote it, Eminem performed the album's songs on televised shows, at award ceremonies, musical events and also headed The Recovery Tour.\n\nIn August 2011, Recovery was certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). At the 2011 Grammy Awards, it was nominated for Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Record of the Year; the latter two were for \"Love the Way You Lie\". The album earned Eminem American Music Awards, Billboard Music Awards and Grammy Awards.\n\nDue to Eminem recording far more material than he could use for one album, he felt that he had to offer his fans more music. After staying on hiatus for so long, fellow D12 member Swift confirmed that Eminem had in fact planned to put out two albums that year, following with Relapse 2 in late 2009. According to Angela Yee's Shade 45 interview with Eminem on April 23, 2009, Relapse 2 was to be a continuation of Relapse. During the interview, Eminem confirmed: \"It's extremely close to being finished, it just depends on how many songs I want to put on it.\" Eminem also explained that the album was more \"emotionally driven\" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, \" rap records\". Guest appearances were expected to come from the likes of Dr. Dre, 50 Cent, D12, Royce da 5'9\", Lloyd Banks and Cashis. The album was subsequently pushed back for an early 2010 release, so Eminem decided to re-release Relapse as Relapse: Refill, which includes a bonus disc featuring seven new tracks, including the single \"Forever\" (originally on More Than a Game soundtrack) and \"Taking My Ball\" (released with DJ Hero), as well as five previously unreleased tracks. During the recording process of the album, Eminem stated that \"The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on Relapse 2, but I still want the other stuff  to be heard\". On its re-release, Eminem stated: \"I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned. Hopefully these tracks on The Refill will tide the fans over until we put out Relapse 2 next year.\n\nOn April 13, 2010, Eminem tweeted \"There is no Relapse 2\", thus announcing that the album had been scrapped in favour of his new project Recovery. While recording Relapse 2 and witnessing the mixed reaction of its predecessor among fans and critics alike, Eminem decided to throw away most of the recorded material and started from scratch. The result appeared to be more of an individual project that deserved its own name, other than a continuation of Relapse. Eminem said: \"I had originally planned for Relapse 2 to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to Relapse started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on Recovery came out very different from Relapse, and I think it deserves its own title. The now-renamed album debuted at number 1 on the US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 741,000 copies in the United States. As of September 25, 2011, the album had sold 4,040,000 copies in the United States and was also the best-selling album of 2010 worldwide, earning a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.\n\nThe track 'Insult to Injury' would have been the leading track according to The Alchemist the producer of the track. 'Hit Me With Your Best Shot' featuring D12 was a track that leaked that was recorded around early 2010 and style was more close to Recovery than Relapse. Cocaine featuring Jazmine Sullivan also leaked but it wasn't confirmand if it was for Relapse 2 or Recovery also recorded in 2010. 'Nut Up' was a leaked song from when Eminem was recording in Hawaii. 'Things Get Worse' was originally recorded in 2009 and was a solo track before Eminem and B.o.B collaborated for B.o.B's Greatest Hits album. On the track \"Zeus\" of Music To Be Murdered By, Eminem apologizes to Rihanna over a leaked version of 'Things Get Worse' in which he sided with Chris Brown, who pleaded guilty to felony assault involving her in 2009. A song of unknown title featuring 50 Cent and two songs lead by Mr. Porter was also expected.\n\nAll the songs from Relapse: Refill were going to be part of Relapse 2. The songs \"On Fire\", \"So Bad\" and \"Ridaz\" from Recovery were recorded in the same sessions in Hawaii which lead to speculation that they could have been intended for Relapse 2. Although after the release of Relapse: Refill it is possible that Eminem had already moved on to Recovery.\n\nThe album was dedicated \"To anyone who's in a dark place tryin' to get out. Keep your head up... It does get better! Eminem told Billboard that he was in \"full-blown addiction\" while recording Encore. He felt happier and \"first got sober\" during the recording of Relapse, having overcome his addiction. While recording Relapse, he admitted that he had not been \"paying attention to what the average listener might like or not like.\" Just Blaze, the first producer of the album said, \" already knew what sort of mistakes he has made with the previous album and where he wanted to go from there.\" Thus, Recovery was more \"emotionally driven\" than Relapse, which was, as he explains, \" rap records. In contrast to Eminem's previous work, the album features no skits, and downplays his Slim Shady alter ego.\n\nThe album's artwork featured two covers: One with Eminem walking down a country road and another with him sitting in a transparent living room in the middle of Detroit with the Renaissance Center in the background. The album's liner featured pictures of Eminem such as a picture of him praying and him posing without a shirt on.\n\nThe record opens with \"Cold Wind Blows\" in which Eminem discusses his \"doomed love for his ex-wife\" and about \"settling scores with rival celebs. In \"Talkin' 2 Myself\", he states the harm caused to his image with lyrics such as: \"Encore' I was on drugs, 'Relapse' I was flushing them out. \"On Fire\" is about \"a murder-and-dismemberment fantasy\" and \"Won't Back Down\", which featured Pink, was a rap-rock song. The singing to \"W.T.P.\" (\"White-Trash Party\") is considered similar to his early records with a lighter and simple rhythmic frame. \"Going Through Changes\", which samples Black Sabbath's \"Changes\", depicts Eminem's sorrow and shows himself trapped within fame. \"Not Afraid\", a mid-tempo song, focuses on personal changes in Eminem, including an end to drug abuse, feuds and violence.\n\nIdolator commented that the song was based on the \"dark days Eminem has lived through,\" and \"he seems to be at peace with himself now. A writer for MuchMusic website noted that Eminem chose to use his Marshall Mathers ego for the song, rather than Slim Shady.\n\n\"No Love\" features Lil Wayne as a hype man. Eminem's verses follow Lil Wayne, and according to Sam Wolfson of NME were \"the best verses of his career. The meaning of \"Space Bound\" is deemed ambiguous and according to Sasha Grey who is featured in its video, the meaning can be interpreted \"in many ways. Jim Jonsin of MTV spoke about Eminem's two egos seen in the video and compared it to Alanis Morissette's \"Ironic\" video while Grey believed that the alternate Eminem who appears in the car is his subconscious.\n\n\"Cinderella Man\" has a \"festive beat\" and \"the template of every album since Encore (2004),\" with many minor keys and traces of post-grunge rock. \"25 to Life\" shows his discomfiture and depicts that the \"selfish bitch\" pulling him back \"these days is rap itself. Despite the lyrics being tighter throughout the album, \"So Bad\" and \"Almost Famous\" view the other side of Slim Shady; his alter ego. The hip-hop ballad \"Love The Way You Lie\", which features Rihanna, describes a couple's refusal to separate despite having an abusive relationship. Rihanna sings the chorus, backed by an electric guitar and a piano, while acoustic guitar, violin and drums accompany Eminem's verses. Rihanna's singing expresses \"grief and regret\" throughout the song.\n\nTo promote the album, Eminem released a freestyle titled \"Despicable\" about \"Over\" by Drake and \"Beamer, Benz, or Bentley\" by Lloyd Banks featuring Juelz Santana to promote the first single, \"Not Afraid\", which debuted on Shade 45 on April 29. Recovery was released on June 18 in Europe and on June 21 in the United States and the United Kingdom.\n\nEminem promoted the album throughout its initial release, doing interviews for brands like Red Bull. A commercial for Recovery premiered during Game 6 of the 2010 NBA Finals. It featured Vince Offer doing a parody of his Slap Chop commercials. There was a Call of Duty: Black Ops ad underscored by \"Won't Back Down\"; the song also appeared in the game as an easter egg.\n\nOn June 15, Eminem appeared among other artists including Usher and will.i.am for Activision's press conference during the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010 with Rihanna where the duo performed \"Love the Way You Lie\". In addition, Eminem performed \"Lose Yourself\", \"Not Afraid\", and premiered \"Won't Back Down\" for the first time. Eminem was featured on E! during their Daily 10 show in an interview with Clinton Sparks and also appeared in a skit on The Soup. He performed songs from the album as well as his previous songs at various events such as the 2010 BET Awards, 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, Electronic Entertainment Expo 2010, Bonnaroo Music Festival, T in the Park and Virgin Group's V Festival. He also headed The Recovery Tour; a series of European, American and Australian concerts in support of the album and its predecessor Relapse.\n\nSingles\n\nThe first single, \"Not Afraid\", was released on April 29, 2010. The song sold 380,000 digital downloads in its first week, and became the sixteenth song in the history of the US Billboard Hot 100 to debut at number one; it is the second hip hop single to debut at number one following \"I'll Be Missing You\" by Puff Daddy and Faith Evans featuring 112.\n\nIt has sold more than 5 million copies and is certified 10× Platinum ♦ by RIAA in the US. \"Not Afraid\" which was directed by Rich Lee, premiered on June 5, 2010 through Vevo.

The song debuted at number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and later peaked number one. The song gave Eminem his fourth US Billboard Hot 100 number one and Rihanna her seventh. It also claimed the top spot on over 20 other charts worldwide. \"Love the Way You Lie\" went on to be number one on the US Billboard Hot 100 for seven consecutive weeks and is certified Diamond by RIAA and has sold more than 6 million in US. The song became Eminem's best-selling single of all time, selling 9.3 million copies worldwide. Joseph Kahn directed the music video which premiered on August 5, 2010. The video starred Dominic Monaghan and Megan Fox. Michael Menachem from Billboard commented that \"Rihanna's chorus is exquisitely melodic and surprisingly hopeful, complementing the turmoil of Em's dark, introspective rant. The song was performed at the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards and was voted the best performer of the ceremony in an MTV poll, earning 34 percent of votes.\n\n\"No Love\", which features American rapper Lil Wayne, was the third single released on October 5, 2010. \"No Love\" featured sample of \"What Is Love\" by Haddaway, which was done by producer Just Blaze. The song peaked number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks. The music video, directed by Chris Robinson, premiered on September 30 via Vevo and various MTV networks. The video was about a young school boy who was bullied but had the urge to stand up after being motivated by listening to songs by Eminem and Lil Wayne. They performed \"No Love\" on Saturday Night Live on December 18, 2010.\n\n\"Space Bound\" was released as the fourth and final single from the album on March 18, 2011.

The porn stars actress Sasha Grey and Eminem in a relationship which ends violently; the video caused controversy for a bloody scene in which Eminem shoots himself. The video was slammed by British anti-violence campaigners. Anti-violence group, Mothers Against Violence, told the Daily Mirror, \"It's all about the money with these videos. Eminem isn't thinking about the families affected.\n\nSongs \"25 to Life\", \"Won't Back Down\", \"Talkin' 2 Myself\", and \"Cold Wind Blows\" also debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 without release as singles.\n\nOn February 28, 2018, \"Cinderella Man\" and \"Won’t Back Down\" were certified Platinum in the United States, while \"Cold Wind Blows\", \"25 to Life\" and \"Talkin’ 2 Myself\" were certified Gold.\n\nRecovery was released to generally favorable reviews with most critics praising the lyrical themes and Eminem's performance. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 63, based on 28 reviews. AllMusic's David Jeffries praised Eminem's performance as potent and energetic, and said that the album \"may be flawed ... but he hasn't sounded this unfiltered and proud since The Marshall Mathers LP\". Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph commended him for addressing more mature, introspective subject matter and successfully \"framing his misogyny, homophobia and all-round bigotry with an undeniable sense of empathy and humanity. Jody Rosen, writing in Rolling Stone, called it Eminem's \"most casual-sounding album in years\" and said that he \"sounds content to be rap's wittiest head case.\n\nSam Wolfson of NME called him \"self-aware, technically advanced, intelligent, able to go at speeds other than full throttle. Sean O'Neal of The A.V. Club stated that his lively raps make up for the \"endless atonement metaphors\" that occasionally weigh down the album. Kitty Empire, writing in The Observer, said that it is \"better than average\" as a \"latterday Eminem album\" that shows, \"in bursts, Eminem's health is very nearly rude.\" MSN Music's Robert Christgau said that, although the cleverness \"varies\" and the themes are \"rarely\" upheld by his \"long-recessive sense of play\", the album is a comeback \"for Eminem, not Slim Shady—and for Marshall at his most martial. His most confessional as well.\n\nIn a mixed review, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times regarded Eminem as \"frustratingly limited in his topical range\" and called Recovery \"the most insular of all his releases. Andy Gill of The Independent commented that \"there's nothing here quite as witty or engaging as\" on his previous work. In a largely negative review, Pitchfork's Jayson Greene perceived a lack of lyrical depth and wrote \"for the first time in his career, he actually sounds clumsy. Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot criticized the writing, and said that it lacks hooks and fun: \"The subversive humor is long gone, and his cultural references ... remain dated. Slant Magazine's M. T. Richards also found Eminem's pop culture references \"inane\" and called the album's material \"unsurprisingly hollow\" with punchlines that \"rarely resonate. Los Angeles Times writer Jeff Weiss found his rhyme schemes \"dazzling\" and wordplay \"clever\", but panned its production as \"monochromatic and monotonous. The Guardian's Paul MacInnes said that the music lacks consistency because of a \"piecemeal approach to production\" and \"fashionable soft-rock samples.\n\nRecovery was ranked 93rd on the Billboard Top 200 Albums of All-Time.\n\nIn 2010, Eminem was nominated for two American Music Awards Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album which he Won it and Favorite Pop/Rock Album.

                    "content": "The Marshall Mathers LP is the third studio album by American rapper  Eminem, released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. The album was produced mostly by Dr. Dre and  Eminem, along with The 45 King, the Bass Brothers, and Mel-Man. Recorded over a two-month period in several studios around Detroit, the album features more introspective lyricism, including  Eminem's thoughts on his rise from rags to riches, the criticism of his music, and his estrangement from his family and wife. A transgressive work, it incorporates horrorcore and hardcore hip-hop, while also featuring satirical songs. Featured appearances include Dido, RBX, Sticky Fingaz, Bizarre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit, Nate Dogg, and D12.\n\nLike its predecessor, The Marshall Mathers LP was surrounded by significant controversy upon its release, while also propelling Eminem to the forefront of American pop culture. Criticism centered on lyrics that were considered violent, homophobic, and misogynistic, as well as the reference to the Columbine High School massacre. Lynne Cheney criticized the lyrics at a United States Senate hearing, while the Canadian government considered refusing  Eminem's entry into the country. Despite the controversy of the album, it received acclaim from critics, who praised  Eminem's lyrical ability and considered the album to have emotional depth.\n\nThe album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200, staying atop for eight consecutive weeks. A significant commercial success compared to the release of The Slim Shady LP just the previous year, the album sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it among the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album produced the singles \"The Real Slim Shady\", \"The Way I Am\", \"Stan\", \"I'm Back\" and \"Bitch Please II\". Among other publications, Rolling Stone named it the best album of 2000.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP has been included in several lists of the greatest albums of all time and is widely regarded as Eminem's best album. It has sold 21 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time and certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was nominated for Album of the Year and won Best Rap Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards, while \"The Real Slim Shady\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. The Marshall Mathers LP 2, the album's sequel, was released in 2013.\n\nBackground\n\nInspired by the disappointment of his debut album, Infinite (1996), Eminem created the alter ego Slim Shady, whom he introduced on the Slim Shady EP (1997). After placing second in the annual Rap Olympics, Eminem was noticed by the staff at Interscope Records and eventually CEO Jimmy Iovine, who played the Slim Shady EP for hip hop producer Dr. Dre. Eminem and Dr. Dre then met and recorded The Slim Shady LP (1999), which was noted for its over-the-top lyrical depictions of drugs and violence. The Slim Shady LP was a critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart and selling 283,000 copies in its first week. At the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the record won Best Rap Album, while the album's lead single \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. The rapper, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter Hailie, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle. In June 1999, he married his girlfriend Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Scott, the mother of Hailie, despite the fact that the song \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP contains references to killing her. The rapper became uncomfortable with the level of fame he had achieved, and said, \"I don't trust nobody now because everybody I meet is meeting me as Eminem...I don't know if they are hanging with me 'cause they like me or because I'm a celebrity or because they think they can get something from me. Eminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial, Billboard editor in chief Timothy White accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery\".\n\nEminem considered naming the album Amsterdam after a trip to the city shortly after the release of The Slim Shady LP, in which he and his friends engaged in heavy drug use. The \"free\" use of drugs Eminem observed during his time in Amsterdam greatly influenced his desire to openly discuss drug use in his music and inspired some of the content on the album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was recorded in a two-month-long \"creative binge\", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording in order to stay focused on working and figuring out how to \"map out\" each song. He described himself as a \"studio rat\" who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, \"We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio.' We just wait and see what happens when we get there. Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from \"fucking around\" in the studio; \"Marshall Mathers\" developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while \"Criminal\" was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. \"Kill You\" was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.\n\n\"Kim\" was the first song the rapper recorded for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote \"Kim\" at a time in which he and his wife were separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, \"I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. To even think about you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. The song \"Stan\" was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's \"Thank You\". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for \"Stan\" differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: \"'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. Dido later heard \"Stan\" and enjoyed it, and observed, \"I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it.' When they sent  to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.\n\nThe record label speculated that Eminem would be the first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These expectations placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, \"I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote \"The Way I Am\" as his way of saying, \"Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is.' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became \"The Real Slim Shady\". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer stated, \"It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people.\n\nMusic and lyrics\n\nConsidered both a horrorcore album and a hardcore hip hop album, much of the album's first half was produced by Dr. Dre and Mel-Man, who employed their typical sparse, stripped-down beats, to put more focus on Eminem's vocals. The background music on the record employs \"liquid basslines, stuttering rhythms, slight sound effects, and spacious soundscapes\". Bass Brothers and Eminem produced most of the second half, which ranges from the laid-back guitars of \"Marshall Mathers\" to the atmosphere of \"Amityville\". The only outside producer on the album was The 45 King, who sampled a verse from Dido's song \"Thank You\" for \"Stan\", while adding a slow bass line.\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP is considered a transgressive work, and contains more autobiographical themes in comparison to The Slim Shady LP. Much of the album is spent addressing his rise to fame and attacking those who criticized his previous album. Other themes include his relationship with his family, including his mother and Kim Mathers, his ex-wife. Unlike Eminem's major-label debut, The Slim Shady LP, The Marshall Mathers LP is more introspective in its lyrics and uses less of the Slim Shady persona, with music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine writing that the album's lyrics \" the distinction between reality and fiction, humor and horror, satire and documentary\". The record showcases a variety of moods, ranging from irreverent and humorous to \"dark and unsettling enough to make you want to enlarge the parental warning stickers on the album. According to Neil Strauss of The New York Times, \"Eminem never makes it clear which character—Slim Shady or Marshall Mathers—is the mask and which is the real person, because there is no clear-cut answer, except that there's a little bit of each character in all of us.\n\nMost songs cover Eminem's childhood struggles and family issues, involving his mother (\"Kill You\"), the relationship struggles with his wife (\"Kim\"), his struggles with his superstardom and expectations (\"Stan\", \"I'm Back\", and \"Marshall Mathers\"), his return and effect on the music industry (\"Remember Me?\", \"Bitch Please II\"), his drug use (\"Drug Ballad\", \"The Kids\"), his effect on the American youth and society (\"The Way I Am\", \"Who Knew\"), and reactionary barbs to critical response of his vulgarity and dark themes (\"Criminal\"). Despite the large amount of controversy regarding the lyrics, the lyrics on the album were overwhelmingly well received among critics and the hip hop community, many praising Eminem's verbal energy and dense rhyme patterns.\n\nThe record also contains lyrics that have been considered to be homophobic. The song \"Criminal\" features the line \"My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge/That'll stab you in the head whether you're a fag or les...Hate fags?/The answer's yes\". The Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) condemned his lyrics and criticized the album for \"encourag violence against gay men and lesbians\". However, writing for the LGBT interest magazine The Advocate, editor Dave White writes, \"If he has gay-bashed you or me, then it logically follows that he has also raped his own mother, killed his wife, and murdered his producer, Dr. Dre. If he's to be taken literally, then so is Britney Spears' invitation to 'hit me baby, one more time'. Eminem noted that he began using the word \"faggot\" more frequently when \"people got all up in arms about it...to piss them off worse\", but added, \"I think it's hard for some people to understand that for me the word 'faggot' has nothing to do with sexual preference. I meant something more like assholes or dickheads. Evangelical Christian religious figure James Dobson also heavily criticized Eminem.\n\nSongs\n\nThe first track, \"Kill You\", discusses the controversy that surrounded the rapper's first album, nightmares of \"ladies' screams\", and being raised by a single mother. In the song, Eminem also talks of raping his mother, and \"notes the irony of magazines trumpeting his mother-raping self on their covers'. The six-and-a-half minute long \"Stan\" samples Dido's \"Thank You\" and tells the story of an exchange between the rapper and an obsessive fan, where the titular character berates Eminem for not responding to his letters, which later turns to the fan committing suicide with his pregnant wife. On \"Who Knew\", the rapper addresses criticism regarding glorification of violence in his lyrics, pointing out perceived hypocrisy in American society. According to Gabriel Alvarez of Complex, Eminem's response ranges oscillates from \"smart-ass ('Oh, you want me to watch my mouth, how?/Take my fuckin' eyeballs out and turn 'em around?') to smart ('Ain't they got the same moms and dads who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?/And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear/What about the makeup you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?').\"Who Knew\" is followed by the \"Steve Berman\" skit, where the president of sales at Interscope Records angrily confronts the rapper about his lyrical content. He notes that Dr. Dre was successful because he rapped about \"big-screen TVs, blunts, 40's, and bitches\", while Eminem raps about \"homosexuals and Vicodin\", and believes that the album will be a commercial disaster.\n\n\"The Way I Am\" is a meditation on the pressure to maintain his fame, and his fear of being \"pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation/to cop me rotation at rock 'n' roll stations\". He also laments the negative media attention received by controversial public figures such as himself and Marilyn Manson in the wake of shootings, including the Columbine High School massacre and the West Side Middle School shooting in Jonesboro, Arkansas. The rapper criticizes the media for focusing on tragedies such as school shootings while ignoring inner-city violence that occurs on a daily basis. \"The Real Slim Shady\" pokes fun at pop culture icons such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Will Smith. \"Remember Me?\" follows and features rappers RBX and Sticky Fingaz, who \"kick seriously Stygian darkness on the ominous track\". In the song, he states \"I'm tryna clean up my fuckin' image / So I promised the fuckin' critics / I wouldn't say 'fuckin' for six minutes/(Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)\". Despite saying the word \"fuck\" one more time in \"Remember Me\", and three times at the beginning of \"I'm Back\", he does not say the word \"fuckin\" for seven minutes and 29 seconds after delivering the original promise, saying it again in the song \"Marshall Mathers\".\n\"I'm Back\" features Eminem's observations regarding his rise to fame, explaining that he \"became a commodity/'Cause I'm W-H-I-T-E\". The next song, \"Marshall Mathers\", mocks the chorus of LFO's \"Summer Girls\", while criticizing the lack of artistic merit of pop stars such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, and Ricky Martin. The song also takes aim at rap duo ICP (Insane Clown Posse), where Eminem raps about Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope being flaming homosexuals. \"Drug Ballad\" features Dina Rae and describes the rapper's struggles with his drug addiction, and writes about some of his experiences under the influence, including ecstasy which makes him \"sentimental as fuck, spilling guts to you/we just met, but I think I'm in love with you\". \"Amityville\" is a bass-heavy ode to living in Detroit, where the rapper discusses the city's crowning as murder capital of the United States. \"Bitch Please II\" features Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Xzibit, and contains elements of g-funk, as well as R&B crooning from Nate Dogg on the chorus.\n\n\"Kim\", the prequel to \"97 Bonnie and Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP, features Eminem \"screaming at his ex in an insane stream-of-consciousness hate spew\". The song begins with Eminem talking softly to his daughter, but as the beat starts, the rapper takes on portraying two characters, utilizing his own enraged, threatening voice, and the terrified shrieks of his wife Kim. As the song ends, Eminem kills her while taunting, \"Bleed, bitch, bleed!\" \"Kim\" is followed by \"Under the Influence\", which sees Eminem speaking in gibberish for the chorus, and later rap group D12 \"runs rampant\" on the track. \"Criminal\" features production from F.B.T., which consists of \"piano licks, swerving synth, and a deceptively simplistic bass rumble over which Em snakes and snarls and warns that 'you can't stop me from topping these charts...''. He pokes fun at critics who take his lyrical content seriously, explaining that \"half the shit I say, I just make it up to make you mad\".\n\nRelease\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was released on May 23, 2000, by Aftermath Entertainment, Interscope Records, in the United States, and on 11 September 2000, by Polydor Records in the United Kingdom. The Marshall Mathers LP was released with two different album covers. The original features Eminem sitting on the porch of the house he lived in during his teenage years. He reflected on the photo shoot by saying, \"I had mixed feelings because I had a lot of good and bad memories in that house. But to go back to where I grew up and finally say, 'I've made it', is the greatest feeling in the world to me. The other cover features the rapper seated in a fetal position beneath a loading dock with alcohol and prescription pill bottles at his feet. Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly likened Eminem's appearance on the cover to a \"dysfunctional Little Rascal\", viewing the image as indicative of the rapper's musical evolution: \"Easy to read, right? The debut: a violent fantasy, the acting-out of a persona. The follow-up: the vulnerable artist unmasked.\nCensorship\nIn his book Edited Clean Version: Technology and the Culture of Control, author Raiford Guins writes that the clean version of The Marshall Mathers LP \"resembles a cross between a cell phone chat with terrible reception...and a noted hip-hop lyricist suffering from an incurable case of hiccups. This version of the album often either omits words completely or obscures them with added sound effects. The clean version of the album did not censor all profanity. Words like \"ass\", \"bitch\", \"goddamn\", and \"shit\" were uncensored. However, on the track \"The Real Slim Shady\", the words \"bitch\" and \"shit\" were censored out, as they used the clean version released for radio. References to violence and weapons were also significantly altered, and the songs \"Kill You\", \"Drug Ballad\" and \"Bitch Please II\" are written as \"**** You\", \"Ballad\" and \"***** Please II\" on the back cover of the album. The song \"Kim\" is removed completely and replaced by the South Park-themed \"The Kids\".\n\nSignificant edits were made to aggressive and violent lyrics that were aimed at police, prostitutes, women, homosexuals, bullies and schools. In response to the attack that had occurred at Columbine High School in April 1999, names of guns and sounds of them firing were censored. Interscope Records insisted on censoring the words \"kids\" and \"Columbine\" from the line, \"I take seven  from , stand them all in line\" from \"I'm Back\", even on the explicit version of the album. Mike Rubin of Spin called the censorship a \"curious decision, given that lyrics like 'Take drugs / Rape sluts' are apparently permissible\". Eminem commented on his lyrics regarding the shooting, \"That Columbine shit is so fucking touchy. As much sympathy as we give the Columbine shootings, nobody ever looked at it from the fuckin' point of view of the kids who were bullied—I mean, they took their own fucking life! And it was because they were pushed so far to the fucking edge that they were fucking so mad. I've been that mad. The full line appears uncensored in Eminem's song \"Rap God\" from The Marshall Mathers LP 2. The line \"It doesn't matter  faggot\" was also censored from \"Marshall Mathers\", which refers to his mother Debbie Nelson's lawyer, who assisted her in filing a lawsuit against the rapper for defamation regarding lyrics from The Slim Shady LP.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP sold 1.78 million copies in its first week, which made it one of the fastest-selling studio albums in the United States. The album sold twice as much as the previous hip hop record holder for first week sales in the US, which was Snoop Dogg's 1993 album Doggystyle. The Marshall Mathers LP sold over 800,000 copies in its 2nd week, 600,000 copies in its 3rd week, and 520,000 copies in its 4th week for a 4-week total of 3.65 million. It also became one of the few albums to sell over half a million copies for 4 consecutive weeks. In total, the album spent 8 weeks at number one on the US Billboard 200, ranking it 4th on the current all-time list of weeks spent at number one by a hip hop album. By the end of 2000, The Marshall Mathers LP had become the second-best-selling album of the year with over 8 million copies sold. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the best-selling album of 2000 in Canada, selling 679,567 copies.\n\nThe album's first single, \"The Real Slim Shady\", became Eminem's biggest hit up to that point. It peaked at number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and topped the UK Singles Charts. \"The Way I Am\", which was released as the album's second single, peaked at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and 58 on the Billboard Hot 100 music chart. \"Stan\", the third single released from the album, became a number one hit in both the United Kingdom and Australia. The song, which details around a crazed fan of the same name, has been highlighted as a work of poetry by critics, and soon gave rise to the Oxford English Dictionary term stan.\n\nIn 2010, Nielsen SoundScan reported that up until November 2009, The Marshall Mathers LP had sold 10,216,000 copies in the US, making it the 4th-best selling album of the decade. The album has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and its sales stand at over 11 million copies in the United States, making it Eminem's best-selling album in his home country. In worldwide sales, the album has sold 21 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. A sequel to the album, The Marshall Mathers LP 2, was released on November 5, 2013.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe Marshall Mathers LP was met with highly positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 21 reviews.\n\nRolling Stone magazine's Touré applauded Dr. Dre's production and Eminem's varied lyrical style on what is a \"car-crash record: loud, wild, dangerous, out of control, grotesque, unsettling\", but ultimately captivating. Melody Maker said that Eminem's startlingly intense vision of \"rap's self-consciousness\" is truly unique, while Steve Sutherland of NME praised the album as a misanthropic and \"gruelling assault course of lyrical genius\" that critiques malevolent aspects of contemporary society. Chuck Eddy from The Village Voice said that Eminem is backed by attractive music and displays an emotionally complex and witting quality unlike his previous work. In the newspaper's consumer guide column, Robert Christgau called him \"exceptionally witty and musical, discernibly thoughtful and good-hearted, indubitably dangerous and full of shit\", while declaring the album \"a work of art whose immense entertainment value in no way compromises its intimations of a pathology that's both personal and political\". Will Hermes of Entertainment Weekly wrote that as the first significant popular music album of the 2000s, The Marshall Mathers LP is \"indefensible and critic-proof, hypocritical and heartbreaking, unlistenable and undeniable\".\n\nOn the other hand, music journalist Greg Kot said the reaction to The Marshall Mathers LP was \"mixed\", or reluctantly positive, among critics who praised Eminem's \"verbal skills and transgressive humor\" but decried some of the subject matter. In his review for the Los Angeles Times, Robert Hilburn reserved his praise because of homophobic lyrics on what he felt is an otherwise conceptual and personal work, \"docked a half star because of the recurring homophobia—something that may be de rigueur in commercial rap, but which still is unacceptable. Steve Jones of USA Today opined that Eminem's \"vicious and patently personal lyrical assaults\" would \"almost grow tedious if he weren't as inventive as he is tasteless.\" Q magazine felt that the subject matter does not make for an enjoyable listen, even though Eminem's disaffected and nihilistic lyrics can be provocative. Slant Magazine's Sal Cinquemani was more critical in a one-and-a-half star review and found his raps extremely distasteful: \"The only thing worse than Eminem's homophobia is the immaturity with which he displays it\". On the other hand, Spin felt that the rapping is excellent, but plagued more so by unremarkable music and lackluster tracks.\n\nAmong other publications, Rolling Stone and Melody Maker named The Marshall Mathers LP the best album of 2000. In 2000, the album won in the Best Album category at the MTV Europe Music Awards. It also won in the Best Rap Album category at the 43rd Grammy Awards in 2001. The Marshall Mathers LP was nominated for Album of the Year, but lost to jazz-rock duo Steely Dan's Two Against Nature.\n\nLegacy and reappraisal\n\nSince its initial release, The Marshall Mathers LP has been highly acclaimed in retrospective critic reviews. It has been regarded by critics as Eminem's best album and has been ranked in multiple lists of the greatest albums of all time. According to Acclaimed Music, it is the 180th most acclaimed album in history. In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Christian Hoard said it \"delved much deeper into personal pain , and the result was a minor masterpiece that merged iller-than-ill flows with a brilliant sense of the macabre.\" According to Sputnikmusic's Nick Butler, The Marshall Mathers LP stands as a culturally significant record in American popular music, but also \"remains a truly special album, unique in rap's canon, owing its spirit to rock and its heritage to rap, in a way I've rarely heard\". Insanul Ahmed of Complex wrote, \"At a time when the Billboard charts were dominated by squeaky-clean pop acts like NSYNC and Backstreet Boys, Eminem offered a rebuttal to the hypocritical American mainstream that criticizes rap music while celebrating—and, worse, commercializing—sex, violence, and bigotry in other arenas. This album turned Eminem into a global icon. There was a huge amount of hype and controversy around it  But none of that takes away from its musical achievement. This album definitively proved that the Detroit rapper was a gifted lyricist, a brilliant songwriter, and a visionary artist. Mike Elizondo, a former collaborator on Eminem's albums, said, “I felt like Marshall was part of this wave with Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction (1994) and Reservoir Dogs (1992)  This next level of art with incredible graphic imagery that Marshall had the ability to paint. Love it or hate it he was obviously very skilled at the stories he was telling.\n\nJeff Weiss of The Ringer wrote, \"The Marshall Mathers LP certified Eminem as an alienated voice of a generation, a caustic wedge issue distilling the spirits of Elvis, Holden Caulfield, Johnny Rotten, Kurt Cobain, Cartman from South Park, and Tupac if he shopped at Kroger. In a postmodern abyss where everything’s performative, it might have been the last album that possessed the capacity to genuinely shock. Dan Ozzi of Vice highlighted that \"Eminem was the one artist high school kids seemed to unanimously connect with.  he represented everything high school years are about: blind rage, misguided rebellion, adolescent frustration. He was like a human middle finger. An X-rated Dennis the Menace for a dial-up modem generation. Max Bell of Spin wrote that the album remains \"one of the most critically-acclaimed, commercially-successful, and influential albums in rap history\", citing rappers influenced by the album, such as Tyler, the Creator, Earl Sweatshirt, Kendrick Lamar, and Juice WRLD. Bonsu Thompson of Medium described the album as \"a masterful confluence of punk, bluegrass, and subterranean hip-hop that gave life to a singular brand of Americana rap. Thompson further praised the album's impact on white rappers, saying, \"For a snapshot of the album’s seismic influence, compare the pre–Marshall Mathers LP decade of White rappers like Everlast and MC Serch with the post-2000 landscape of Action Bronson, G-Eazy, and the late Mac Miller  Eminem homogenized the White rapper. In 2003, The Marshall Mathers LP was ranked number 302 on Rolling Stone's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time; it was moved up to number 244 in the magazine's revised 2012 edition of the list, and moved to 145 on the 2020 edition. IGN named it the twenty-fourth greatest rap album of all time in a 2004 list. In 2006, The Marshall Mathers LP was included by Time in its list of the 100 Greatest Albums of All Time. That same year, Q ranked it number 85 on a list of The Greatest Albums of All Time, the highest position held by any hip hop album on the list. The Marshall Mathers LP was also the highest ranked hip hop album on the National Association of Recording Merchandisers & the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's list of the 200 Definitive Albums of All Time, where it was placed at number 28. It has been named one of the Top 100 Albums of the Decade (2000s) by Rolling Stone, who ranked it seventh, Complex Magazine, who ranked it fourth, and Pitchfork, who ranked it 119th. The Guardian ranked the album at 29 on its Top 50 Albums of the decade. The A.V. Club ranked the album at 36 on its Best Albums of the Decade list.

The album was also included in the book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\nControversy\n\nWhile the album was hugely controversial and criticized, Eminem propelled to the forefront of American pop culture. At a United States Senate hearing, Lynne Cheney criticized Eminem and sponsor Seagram for \"promot violence of the most degrading kind against women\", labeling him as \"a rap singer who advocates murder and rape\". She specifically cited lyrics from \"Kill You\", explaining, \"He talks about murdering and raping his mother. He talks about choking women slowly so he can hear their screams for a long time. He talks about using O.J.'s machete on women, and this is a man who is honored by the recording industry\". Cheney drew a link between the Columbine massacre and violent music, mentioning artists Eminem and Marilyn Manson as musicians who contribute to the United States' culture of violence. Although she stated that she has \"long been a vocal supporter of free speech\", Cheney called for the music industry to impose age-restrictions on those who can purchase music with violent content.\n\nOn October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's SkyDome. However, Ontario Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. \"I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women\", he said. Flaherty claims to have been \"disgusted\" when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song \"Kill You\", which includes lines like \"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more? Eminem's fans argued that this was a matter of free speech and that he was unfairly singled out. Michael Bryant suggested that the government let Eminem perform and then prosecute him for violating Canada's hate crime laws, despite the fact that Canada's hate-crime legislation does not include violence against women. In an editorial in The Globe and Mail, author Robert Everett-Green wrote, \"Being offensive is Eminem's job description. Eminem was granted entry into Canada.\n\nA 2001 and 2004 study by Edward Armstrong found that of the 14 songs on The Marshall Mathers LP eleven contain violent and misogynistic lyrics and nine depict killing women through choking, stabbing, drowning, shooting, head and throat splitting. According to the study, Eminem scores 78% for violent misogyny while gangsta rap music in general reaches 22%. Armstrong argues that violent misogyny characterizes most of Eminem's music and that the rapper \"authenticates his self-presentations by outdoing other gangsta rappers in terms of his violent misogyny. A fifteen-year-old boy in Fresno, California was arrested in September 2015 for making terrorist threats, after sharing the Columbine-related lyrics to \"I'm Back\" on Instagram.\n\nReactions from other artists\n\nProtests against the album's content reached a climax when it was nominated for four Grammy Awards in 2001 including Album of the Year. At the ceremony, Eminem performed \"Stan\" in a duet with openly gay artist Elton John playing piano and singing the chorus. This performance was a direct response to claims by GLAAD and others who claimed his lyrics were homophobic, with Eminem stating, \"Of course I'd heard of Elton John, but I didn't know he was gay. I didn't know anything about his personal life. I didn't really care, but being that he was gay and he had my back, I think it made a statement in itself saying that he understood where I was coming from. GLAAD did not change its position, however, and spoke out against Elton John's decision. Despite significant protests and debate, The Marshall Mathers LP went on to win Best Rap Album.\n\nSinger Christina Aguilera was upset about the lyric, \"Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst / and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first\" from \"The Real Slim Shady\", calling the rapper's claim \"disgusting, offensive and, above all, not true\". Eminem included this line after becoming angry with the singer for informing the public during an MTV special without his consent about the rapper's secret marriage to Kim Mathers. However, the two later settled their differences after hugging backstage at the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards, with the singer appearing at the premiere of 8 Mile months later.\n\nIn 2002, French jazz pianist Jacques Loussier filed a $10 million lawsuit against Eminem, claiming the beat for \"Kill You\" was stolen from his song \"Pulsion\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Marshall+Mathers+LP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on February 23, 1999, by Aftermath Entertainment and Interscope Records. Recorded in Ferndale, Michigan following Eminem's recruitment by Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine, the album features production from Dr. Dre, Bass Brothers, and Eminem himself.\n\nFeaturing West Coast hip hop, G-funk and horrorcore musical styles, the majority of The Slim Shady LP's lyrical content is written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, named Slim Shady, whom he created on the Slim Shady EP (1997). The Slim Shady LP contains cartoonish depictions of violence and heavy use of profanity, which Eminem referred to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff,\" describing it as horror film-esque, in that it is solely for entertainment value. Although many of the lyrics on the album are considered to be satirical, Eminem also depicts his frustrations of living in poverty.\n\nThe Slim Shady LP debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, just below TLC's FanMail, and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It received commercial and critical success, with critics praising Eminem for his unique lyrical style, dark humor lyrics, and eccentric personality. The first single, \"My Name Is\", became Eminem's first entry on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won Best Rap Album at the 2000 Grammy Awards, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. In 2000, The Slim Shady LP was certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nWhile The Slim Shady LP's success turned Eminem from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity, he became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content, which some perceived to be misogynistic and a negative influence on U.S. youth. Despite this, the album's success was vital in breaking the stereotype that \"white people cannot rap\", and has since been included in several publications' lists of the greatest albums of all time. Spin later included it in their list of \"The 300 Best Albums of 1985–2014\".\n\nBackground\n\nEminem, born Marshall Bruce Mathers III, began rapping at age fourteen. In 1996, his debut album Infinite, which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the Bass Brothers, was released under their independent record label Web Entertainment. Infinite achieved very little commercial success and was largely ignored by Detroit radio stations. The disappointment from this experience greatly influenced his lyrical style: \"After that record, every rhyme I wrote got angrier and angrier. A lot of it was because of the feedback I got. Motherfuckers was like, 'You're a white boy, what the fuck are you rapping for? Why don't you go into rock & roll?' All that type of shit started pissing me off.\" After the release of Infinite, Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in a suicide attempt.\n\nThe disappointment of Infinite inspired Eminem to create the alter ego Slim Shady: \"Boom, the name hit me, and right away I thought of all these words to rhyme with it.\" Slim Shady served as Eminem's vent for his frustrations, and in the spring of 1997, he recorded the eight-song extended play Slim Shady EP. During this time, Eminem and his girlfriend Kim Scott lived in a high-crime neighborhood with their newborn daughter Hailie, where their house was burglarized numerous times. After being evicted from his home, Eminem traveled to Los Angeles to participate in the Rap Olympics, an annual nationwide rap battle competition. He placed second, and the staff at Interscope Records who attended the Rap Olympics sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for hip hop producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment. Dr. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\" Some urged Dr. Dre not to take a chance on Eminem because he was white. Dr. Dre responded, \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple. If you can kick it, I'm working with you.\" Eminem and Dr. Dre subsequently began work on Eminem's major-label debut album.\n\nRecording\n\nThe Slim Shady LP was recorded at Studio 8 at 430 8 Mile Road in Ferndale, Michigan. Eminem, who had idolized Dr. Dre since listening to his group N.W.A as a teenager, was nervous to work with him on the album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\" However, Eminem became more comfortable working with Dr. Dre after a series of highly productive recording sessions. The recording process generally began with Dr. Dre creating a beat and Eminem using the tracks as a template for his freestyle raps; \"Every beat he would make, I had a rhyme for\", Eminem recalled. He later said: \"Every time I sat down with a pen, everything was just like: fuck you, fuck this, fuck them, fuck that, fuck the world, fuck what everybody thinks. Fuck them.\" On the first day of recording, Eminem and Dr. Dre finished \"My Name Is\" in an hour. Three other songs, including \"Role Model\", were also recorded that day.\n\n\"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\", which was formerly featured on the Slim Shady EP as \"Just the Two of Us\", was re-recorded for The Slim Shady LP to feature his daughter Hailie's vocals. Because the song focuses on disposing of his girlfriend's corpse, Eminem was not comfortable with explaining the situation to Kim, and instead told her that he would be taking Hailie to Chuck E. Cheese's. However, he really took her to the recording studio. He explained, \"When she found out I used our daughter to write a song about killing her, she fucking blew. We had just got back together for a couple of weeks. Then I played her the song and she bugged the fuck out.\" Eminem also said, \"When she (Hailie) gets old enough, I'm going to explain it to her. I'll let her know that Mommy and Daddy weren't getting along at the time. None of it was to be taken too literally, although at the time I wanted to fucking do it.\" The song \"Guilty Conscience\" contains a humorous reference to an occasion in which Dr. Dre assaulted Dee Barnes. Having only known Dr. Dre for a few days, Eminem was anxious about how he would react to such a line, and to his relief, Dr. Dre \"fell out of his chair laughing\" upon hearing the lyric.\n\n\"Ken Kaniff\", a skit involving a prank call to Eminem, featured fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle. After a falling out between the two in the wake of Eminem's breakthrough success, Eminem instead played Ken Kaniff on skits on future albums. Ken Kaniff would end up appearing in more Eminem albums over the course of his career and was last heard in The Marshall Mathers LP 2. Another skit, \"Bitch\", is an answering machine message in which Zoe Winkler, daughter of actor Henry Winkler, tells a friend that she was disgusted by Eminem's music. He met and had dinner with her in order to get permission to use the recording on the album. During the mixing process of The Slim Shady LP, at the same time, Kid Rock was recording his fourth studio album, Devil Without a Cause; being friends with Kid Rock, Eminem asked Kid Rock to record scratching for Eminem's song \"My Fault\", which appears on The Slim Shady LP; in return, Eminem delivered a guest rap verse on Kid Rock's song \"Fuck Off\" for Devil Without a Cause.\n\nProduction\nThe album's production was handled primarily by Dr. Dre, the Bass Brothers, and Eminem. The beats have been compared to West Coast hip hop and G-funk musical styles. Kyle Anderson of MTV wrote that \"The beats are full of bass-heavy hallucinations and create huge, scary sandboxes that allow Em to play.\" According to the staff at IGN, \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" is backed by the \"lulling serenity of a super silky groove\". \"Cum on Everybody\"; which features guest vocals from American singer Dina Rae contains an upbeat dance rhythm, while \"My Name Is\", which is built around a sample from British musician Labi Siffre's \"I Got The\", features a prominent bassline and psychedelic-style keyboards. \"I'm Shady\" was originally written over a Sade track, but after hearing a sample of Curtis Mayfield's \"Pusherman\" in Ice-T's song \"I'm Your Pusher\", Eminem decided it would be more fitting to use \"Pusherman\".\n\nEminem's vocal inflection on the album has been described as a \"nasal whine\"; Jon Pareles of The New York Times likened his \"calmly sarcastic delivery\" to \"the early Beastie Boys turned cynical\". Writing for the Chicago Tribune, columnist Greg Kot compared the rapper's vocals to \"Pee-wee Herman with a nasal Midwestern accent\". A skit entitled \"Lounge\" appears before \"My Fault\" featuring Eminem and the Bass Brothers imitating rat pack crooners. Jeff Bass came up with the line \"I never meant to give you mushrooms\" for the skit, which in turn inspired Eminem to write \"My Fault\".\n\nLyrical themes\n\nMany of the songs from The Slim Shady LP are written from the perspective of Eminem's alter ego, Slim Shady, and contain cartoonish depictions of violence, which he refers to as \"made-up tales of trailer-park stuff\". The rapper explained that this subject matter is intended for entertainment value, likening his music to the horror film genre: \"Why can't people see that records can be like movies? The only difference between some of my raps and movies is that they aren't on a screen.\" Some of the lyrics have also been considered to be misogynistic by critics and commentators. Eminem acknowledged the accusations, and clarified, \"I have a fairly salty relationship with women ... But most of the time, when I'm saying shit about women, when I'm saying 'bitches' and 'hoes', it's so ridiculous that I'm taking the stereotypical rapper to the extreme. I don't hate women in general. They just make me mad sometimes.'\" Despite the album's explicit nature, Eminem refused to say the word \"nigga\" on the album, noting, \"It's not in my vocabulary.\" The Slim Shady LP begins with a \"Public Service Announcement\" introduction performed by producer Jeff Bass of the Bass Brothers, and serves as a sarcastic disclaimer discussing the album's explicit lyrical content. Later in the album, a skit entitled \"Paul\" features a phone call from Paul Rosenberg to Eminem telling him to \"tone down\" his lyrics.\n\n\"Guilty Conscience\" is a concept song featuring Dr. Dre. The song focuses on a series of characters who are faced with various situations, while Dr. Dre and Eminem serve as the \"angel\" and \"devil\" sides of the characters' conscience, respectively. The song draws inspiration from a scene in the 1978 comedy film National Lampoon's Animal House, in which a man takes advice from an angel and devil on his shoulder while considering raping an unconscious girl at a party. In the film, he ends up deciding not to go through with the rape, but in \"Guilty Conscience\", the outcome is unclear. On \"My Fault\", Eminem tells the story of a girl who overdoses on psychedelic mushrooms at a rave. \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" features Eminem convincing his infant daughter to assist him in disposing of his wife's corpse. It is an epilogue to the song \"Kim\", although \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" was released first. Eminem wrote the song at a time in which he felt that Kim was stopping him from seeing his daughter. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic explained that \"There have been more violent songs in rap, but few more disturbing, and it's not because of what it describes, it's how he describes it -- how the perfectly modulated phrasing enhances the horror and black humor of his words.\" On the song \"Brain Damage\", Eminem discusses his childhood experiences with bullies at school, particularly recalling a traumatic incident where he sustained a serious concussion after he was severely beaten by a bully.\n\nAlthough many of the lyrics on the album are intended to be humorous, several songs depict Eminem's frustrations with living in poverty. When discussing The Slim Shady LP, Anthony Bozza of Rolling Stone described Eminem as \"probably the only MC in 1999 who boasts low self-esteem. His rhymes are jaw-droppingly perverse, bespeaking a minimum-wage life devoid of hope, flushed with rage and weaned on sci-fi and slasher flicks.\" Eminem was inspired to write \"Rock Bottom\" after being fired from his cooking job at a restaurant days before his daughter's birthday. The song bemoans human dependency on money, discussing its ability to brainwash an individual. He illustrates his struggles to provide for his daughter, describing himself as \"discouraged, hungry, and malnourished.\" \"If I Had\" follows a similar theme, as he describes living on minimum wage and remarks that he is \"tired of jobs starting off at $5.50 an hour\". In the song, he expresses his irritation with fitting the \"white trash\" stereotype.\n\nCritical reception\n\nThe album was met with critical acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five, praising the rapper's \"expansive vocabulary and vivid imagination\", adding that \"Years later, as the shock has faded, it's those lyrical skills and the subtle mastery of the music that still resonate, and they're what make The Slim Shady LP one of the great debuts in both hip-hop and modern pop music.\" David Browne of Entertainment Weekly described the album's \"unapologetic outrageousness\" as a reaction to the \"soul positivity\" of conscious hip hop, noting that \"The Slim Shady LP marks the return of irreverent, wiseass attitude to the genre, heard throughout the album in its nonstop barrage of crudely funny rhymes ... Even pop fans deadened to graphic lyrics are likely to flinch.\" Soren Baker of the Los Angeles Times gave the album three and a half stars out of four and stated that \"He isn't afraid to say anything; his lyrics are so clever that he makes murder sound as if it's a funny act he may indulge in simply to pass the time\" but lamented the \"sometimes flat production that takes away from the power of Eminem's verbal mayhem.\"\n\nMany reviewers commented on the album's lyrical content. Gilbert Rodman of Popular Communications states, \"Eminem's music contains more than its fair share of misogynistic and homophobic lyrics, but simply to reduce it to these (as many critics do) doesn't help to explain Eminem. It merely invokes a platitude or a sound bite to explain him away.\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone enjoyed the record's comedic nature, writing \"Simply put: Eminem will crack you up\", but also felt that the misogynistic lyrics grow tiresome, noting that \"the wife-killing jokes of \"97 Bonnie and Clyde' aren't any funnier than Garth Brooks', and 'My Fault' belongs on some sorry-ass Bloodhound Gang record.\" Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club felt that although the album is \"sophomoric and uninspired\" at times, Eminem's \"surreal, ultraviolent, trailer-trash/post-gangsta-rap extremism is at least a breath of fresh air in a rap world that's despairingly low on new ideas.\" Mike Rubin of Spin noted that \"his scenarios are so far-fetched the songs almost never sound as ugly as they actually are.\" Chris Dafoe of The Globe and Mail opined that \"Abused by fellow students and teachers, cheated on by his girlfriend, despised by society, Shady goes over the top now and then - or rather way over the top - but Dre's lean production, full of strange voice and comic interjections, hold things together.\" Reviewing for The Village Voice in 1999, Robert Christgau called the record a \"platinum-bound cause celebre\" and, despite succumbing to \"dull sensationalism\" toward the end, Eminem shows \"more comic genius than any pop musician since\", possibly, Loudon Wainwright III.\"\n\nAccolades\nSee also: List of awards and nominations received by Eminem\nAt the 42nd Grammy Awards in 2000, the album won Best Rap Album, while \"My Name Is\" won Best Rap Solo Performance. Rolling Stone ranked The Slim Shady LP number 275 on its list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and 33 on its list of the \"100 Best Albums of the '90s\". Blender ranked it number 49 in its list of The 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time. \"Ken Kaniff\" was listed as number 15 on Complex's \"50 Greatest Hip-Hop Skits\" list, while the \"Public Service Announcement\" introduction to the album, along with the \"Public Service Announcement 2000\" introduction from The Marshall Mathers LP, was listed as number 50 on the list. It also won Outstanding National Album at the 2000 Detroit Music Awards. In 2015, it was ranked at number 76 by About.com in their list of \"100 best hip-hop albums of all time\". Christgau later named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nIn the album's first week of release, The Slim Shady LP sold 283,000 copies, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200 chart behind TLC's FanMail. The record remained on the Billboard 200 for 100 weeks. It also reached number one on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart, staying on the chart for 92 weeks. On April 5, 1999, The Slim Shady LP was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales of over one million copies. On November 15, 2000, the album was certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA. \"My Name Is\", the album's lead single, peaked at number 36 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the chart for ten weeks. The single additionally peaked at number 18 on the magazine's R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, 29 on the Pop Songs chart, and 37 on the Alternative Songs chart. \"Guilty Conscience\" reached number 56 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, while \"Just Don't Give a Fuck\" peaked at number 62 on the chart.\n\nBy November 2013, the album sold 5,437,000 copies in the United States. on the weekly Canadian Albums Chart and remained on the chart for twelve weeks. Additionally, the album was certified triple platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association for shipments of over 200,000 units.

In Australia, the album peaked at number 49 on the ARIA Chart, and was eventually certified platinum in the country. The album had also peaked at the number 20 and 23 chart positions in the Netherlands and New Zealand, respectively. It was certified gold in the Netherlands and platinum in New Zealand.\n\nAftermath\n\nAfter the success of The Slim Shady LP, Eminem went from an underground rapper into a high-profile celebrity. Interscope Records awarded him with his own record label, Shady Records; the first artist Eminem signed was rapper and his best friend Proof. Eminem, who had previously struggled to provide for his daughter, noted a drastic change in his lifestyle: \"This last Christmas, there were so many fucking presents under the tree ... My daughter wasn't born with a silver spoon in her mouth. But she's got one now. I can't stop myself from spoiling her. To promote The Slim Shady LP, Eminem embarked on an extensive tour schedule. He joined the Vans Warped Tour as a last-minute replacement for Cypress Hill, a schedule that included 31 North American dates from June 25 to July 31, beginning in San Antonio and ending in Miami. He often played a show in the afternoon on the Warped Tour, and then drove to another location to perform at a hip hop club at night. During a performance in Hartford, Connecticut near the end of the Warped Tour, Eminem slipped on a puddle of liquid and fell ten feet down off the stage, cracking several ribs.] He recalled that the stress of his newfound fame led him to drink excessively, and reflected, \"I knew I had to slow it down. The fall was like a reminder.\" However, after receiving medical attention, he was well enough to travel to New York the following day for a performance on Total Request Live.\n\nEminem also became a highly controversial figure due to his lyrical content. He was labeled as \"misogynist, a nihilist and an advocate of domestic violence\", and in an editorial by Billboard editor in chief Timothy White, the writer accused Eminem of \"making money by exploiting the world's misery.\" During a radio interview in San Francisco, Eminem reportedly angered local DJ Sista Tamu due to a freestyle about \"slapping a pregnant bitch\" to the extent that on air she broke a copy of The Slim Shady LP. The rapper defended himself by saying, \"My album isn't for younger kids to hear. It has an advisory sticker, and you must be eighteen to get it. That doesn't mean younger kids won't get it, but I'm not responsible for every kid out there. I'm not a role model, and I don't claim to be.\n\nLawsuits\n\nOn September 17, 1999, Eminem's mother, Deborah Nelson, filed a $10 million lawsuit against him for slander based on his claim that she uses drugs in the line \"I just found out my mom does more dope than I do\" from \"My Name Is\". After a two-year-long trial, she was awarded $25,000, of which she received $1,600 after legal fees. Eminem was not surprised that his mother had filed the lawsuit against him, referring to her as a \"lawsuit queen\", and alleging that \"That's how she makes money. When I was five, she had a job on the cash register at a store that sold chips and soda. Other than that, I don't remember her working a day in her life.\" She later filed another lawsuit against him for emotional damages suffered during the first trial, which was later dismissed.\n\nIn December 2001, DeAngelo Bailey, a janitor living in Roseville, Michigan who was made the subject of the song \"Brain Damage\" in which he is portrayed as a school bully, filed a $1 million lawsuit against Eminem for slander and invasion of privacy. Bailey's attorney stated \"Eminem is a Caucasian male who faced criticism within the music industry that he had not suffered through difficult circumstances growing up and he was therefore a 'pretender' in the industry ... Eminem used Bailey, his African-American childhood schoolmate, as a pawn in his effort to stem the tide of criticism.\" In 1982, Eminem's mother unsuccessfully sued the Roseville school district for not protecting her son, as she claimed that attacks from bullies caused him headaches, nausea, and antisocial behavior. Additionally, Bailey had previously admitted to bullying Eminem in the April 1999 issue of Rolling Stone Magazine. The lawsuit was dismissed by judge Deborah Servitto in 2003, who wrote her ruling in the form of rap-like rhyme. She ruled that the lyrics—which include the school principal collaborating with Bailey, and Eminem's entire brain falling out of his head—were too exaggerated for a listener to believe that they were recalling an actual event. The verdict was upheld in 2005, and Bailey's lawyer ruled out any further appeals.\n\nIn September 2003, 70-year-old widow Harlene Stein filed suit against Eminem and Dr. Dre on the grounds that \"Guilty Conscience\" contains an unauthorized sample of \"Go Home Pigs\" composed for the film Getting Straight by her husband, Ronald Stein, who died in 1988. Although the album's liner notes state that the song contains an \"interpolation\" of \"Go Home Pigs\", Stein is not credited as a composer and his wife was not paid royalties for use of the song. The lawsuit requested for 5 percent of the retail list price of 90 percent of the all copies of the record sold in America, and 2.5 percent of the retail price of 90 percent of the copies of the album sold internationally. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/The+Slim+Shady+LP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It reached number one on several charts, including the US Billboard 200 and UK Albums Chart.\n\n\"Curtain Call: The Hits\" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and Billboard 200, after two sales days, in a similar fashion to  Eminem's previous album Encore. The album racked up first-week sales of nearly 441,000 and with close to 324,000 scans the second week for a two-week stay at number one. It slipped from number one to number four in its third week but surged 33 percent to finish with sales close to 430,000. The disc scored nearly 1.2 million scans in its first three weeks of release. It also gave Eminem his fifth straight number 1 album in the US and UK when including the 8 Mile soundtrack. As of November 2013, the record had sold 3,782,000 copies in the United States. \"Curtain Call\" was later certified septuple-platinum by the RIAA in the United States.\n\nThe album's two singles, \"When I'm Gone\" and \"Shake That\", peaked at numbers 8 and 6 respectively in the US Billboard Hot 100. Only \"When I'm Gone\" qualified for the charts in the UK, where it peaked at #4.\n\nIn August 2017, the album was declared the longest-running rap LP in the history of the Billboard 200.\n\nA clean version of the album is also available. It has 15 tracks with both \"Intro\" and \"FACK\" removed (due to the extreme sexual nature of the latter, and the former's connection to the song) and \"My Name Is\" put to track one. The tracks appear exactly how they appeared on the clean versions of their respective albums except for the song \"Guilty Conscience\", which uses the radio edit. Certain profanities remain on several tracks, as words including \"shit\", \"bitch\", and \"ass\" were not censored on \"The Slim Shady LP\" or \"The Marshall Mathers LP\". However, on \"Just Lose It\", the clean version leaves \"ass\" uncensored, while on the album Encore, the word \"ass\" was replaced with \"thing\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Eminem/Curtain+Call:+The+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Rumours is the eleventh studio album by British-American rock band Fleetwood Mac. Largely recorded in California during 1976, it was produced by the band with Ken Caillat and Richard Dashut and was released on 4 February 1977 by Warner Bros. Records. The record peaked at the top of both the main United States Billboard chart and the United Kingdom Albums Chart. \"Go Your Own Way\", \"Don't Stop\", \"Dreams\", and \"You Make Loving Fun\" were released as singles. A Grammy Award winner, Rumours is Fleetwood Mac's most successful release with sales of over 40 million copies worldwide, and diamond certifications in several countries, including the US, UK and Australia.\n\nThe band wanted to expand on the commercial success of the 1975 record Fleetwood Mac, but struggled with relationship breakups before recording started. The Rumours studio sessions were marked by hedonistic behaviour and interpersonal strife between Fleetwood Mac members; these experiences informed the album's lyrics. Influenced by pop music, the record's tracks were recorded using a combination of acoustic and electric instruments. The mixing process delayed the completion of Rumours, but was finished by the end of 1976. Following the album's release in 1977, Fleetwood Mac undertook worldwide promotional tours.\n\nRumours garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centred on its production quality and harmonies, which frequently relied on the interplay among three vocalists. The record has inspired the work of musical acts in different genres. Often considered Fleetwood Mac's best release, it has featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1970s and the best albums of all time. In 2004, Rumours was remastered and reissued with the addition of an extra track and a bonus CD of outtakes from the recording sessions.\n\nIn July 1975, Fleetwood Mac's tenth album was released to great commercial success, eventually selling over four million copies and reaching #1 in 1976. The record's hit single \"Rhiannon\" gave the band extensive radio exposure. At the time, Fleetwood Mac's line-up consisted of guitarist and vocalist Lindsey Buckingham, drummer Mick Fleetwood, keyboardist and vocalist Christine McVie, bassist John McVie, and vocalist Stevie Nicks. After six months of non-stop touring, the McVies divorced, ending nearly eight years of marriage. The couple stopped talking to each other socially and discussed only musical matters. Buckingham and Nicks—who had joined the band before 1975's Fleetwood Mac and after guitarist Bob Welch had left were having an on/off relationship that led them to fight often. The duo's arguments stopped only when they worked on songs together. Fleetwood faced domestic problems of his own after discovering that his wife Jenny, mother of his two children, had an affair with his best friend.\n\nPress intrusions into the band members' lives led to inaccurate stories. Christine McVie was reported to be in hospital with a serious illness, while Buckingham and Nicks were declared the parents of Fleetwood's daughter Lucy after being photographed with her. The press also wrote about a rumoured return of original Fleetwood Mac members Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Jeremy Spencer for a 10th anniversary tour. Despite false reports, the band did not change line-up, although its members had no time to come to terms with the separations before recording for a new album began. Fleetwood has noted the \"tremendous emotional sacrifices\" made by everyone just to attend studio work. In early 1976, Fleetwood Mac crafted some new tracks in Florida. Founding members Fleetwood and John McVie chose to dispense with the services of their previous producer, Keith Olsen, because he favoured a lower emphasis on the rhythm section. The duo formed a company called Seedy Management to represent the band's interests.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Rumours\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

When they were led by Bob Welch they often flirted with pop, even recording the first version of the unabashedly smooth and sappy \"Sentimental Lady,\" which would later be one of the defining soft rock hits of the late '70s. Still, there's no denying that 1975's Fleetwood Mac represents not just the rebirth of the band, but in effect a second debut for the group -- the introduction of a band that would dominate the sound of American and British mainstream pop for the next seven years. In fact, in retrospect, it's rather stunning how thoroughly Buckingham and Nicks, who had previously recorded as a duo and were romantically entangled in the past, overtook the British blues band. As soon as the Californian duo came onboard, Fleetwood Mac turned into a West Coast pop/rock band, transforming the very identity of the band and pushing the band's other songwriter, keyboardist Christine McVie, to a kindred soft rock sound. It could have all been too mellow if it weren't for the nervy, restless spirit of Buckingham, whose insistent opener, \"Monday Morning,\" sets the tone for the rest of the album, as well the next few years of the group's career. Surging with a pushily melodic chorus and a breezy Californian feel, the song has little to do with anything the Mac had done before this, and it is a positively brilliant slice of pop songwriting, simultaneously urgent and timeless. After that barnstorming opener, Buckingham lies back a bit, contributing only two other songs -- a cover of Richard Curtis' \"Blue Letter,\" the second best up-tempo song here, and the closer, \"I'm So Afraid\" -- while the rest of the album is given over to the wily spirits of Nicks and McVie, whose singles \"Rhiannon,\" \"Say You Love Me,\" and \"Over My Head\" deservedly made this into a blockbuster. But a bandmember's contribution can never be reduced to his own tracks, and Buckingham not only gives the production depth, he motivates the rest of the band, particularly Nicks and McVie, to do great work, not just on the hit singles but the album tracks that give this record depth. It was diverse without being forced, percolating with innovative ideas, all filtered through an accessible yet sophisticated sensibility. While Rumours had more hits and Tusk was an inspired work of mad genius, Fleetwood Mac wrote the blueprint for Californian soft rock of the late '70s and was the standard the rest were judged by. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, Rovi <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Fleetwood+Mac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was however reissued on vinyl in 2010.\n\nA similar release with the same title and same cover was released by Sony BMG in 1989, but consisted of the tracks from The Pious Bird of Good Omen plus \"Shake Your Moneymaker\" and \"Love That Burns\". This release should not be confused with the identically titled but entirely different 1988 release on Warner Brothers, Greatest Hits. That compilation concentrates exclusively on post-1975 material and has no tracks in common with the 1971 Greatest Hits nor the 1988 variant.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fleetwood+Mac/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following the breakthrough success of her debut album Pure Heroine, Lorde retreated from the spotlight and traveled between New Zealand and the United States to examine the world around her. Initially inspired by her disillusionment with fame, she wrote Melodrama to capture heartbreak and solitude after her first breakup.\n\nMelodrama has been described by critics as a loose concept album that explores the theme of solitude, in the framework of a single house party with the events and moods that entail it. Lorde wrote and produced the album alongside Jack Antonoff, with additional production contributions from Frank Dukes, Malay, Andrew Wyatt, Joel Little, and Flume, among others. The album topped the charts in New Zealand, Australia, the United States, and Canada. Melodrama received widespread acclaim from critics, with some publications citing it as the best album of the year.\n\nThe album was Lorde's first number-one in the United States and Canada and also peaked atop the charts in Australia and New Zealand. It received gold or platinum certifications in the said countries and the United Kingdom. Melodrama received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics and was featured on various year-end and decade-end lists. It won a New Zealand Music Award for Album of the Year and received a nomination for Album of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards in 2018. In 2020, Melodrama ranked at number 460 on Rolling Stone's revision of their 500 Greatest Albums of All-Time list.\n\nInspired in part by the “emotions and insights” gained after her breakup with longtime boyfriend James Lowe, Lorde calls Melodrama “a record about being alone… The good parts and the bad parts”.\n\nLead single Green Light was released on March 2, 2017, following a mysterious marketing campaign culminating in a seven-second preview of the song.\n\nThe second single Liability was released on March 9, 2017, without any publicity or promotion. The piano-driven ballad showcases a softer side of Lorde as she opens up about a more personal time in her life. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/Melodrama\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Lorde wrote and produced the album with American musician Jack Antonoff, whom she worked with on her second studio album, Melodrama (2017), as well. She opted against CDs for environmental reasons, releasing Solar Power to digital music platforms, streaming services, and as vinyl LPs only.\n\nThe album was preceded by Going South, a June 2021 memoir documenting Lorde's 2019 visit to Antarctica, which she dubbed as the precursor to the album. She stated the title Solar Power was inspired by the trip, and that she \"felt like  could just chill out and flex a little bit\" while creating the record.\n\nClassified by Lorde as her \"weed album\", Solar Power is a psychedelic pop and indie folk effort driven by acoustic guitar arrangements, marking a departure from the synth-heavy, dance-oriented music of her previous works. The album's lyrics revolve around solipsism and summer escapism, mainly focusing on Lorde's leisure time in her homeland New Zealand, simultaneously expressing her disdain for fame and celebrity culture.\n\nOn June 10, 2021, the year’s only solar eclipse, Lorde released the album’s lead single Solar Power and sent an email to fans, revealing it is also the album’s title. The song was also accompanied by a music video.\n\nOn June 21, 2021, the summer solstice, the album became available to pre-order on Lorde’s website, revealing the tracklist and final release date. She also sent another email to fans writing: \n\"Greetings my babies, and happy solstice.\nFor those who don’t know, the summer solstice is the day when the Sun charts her longest course through the sky. It’s the longest and most light day of the year. Cultures have celebrated the solstice for thousands of years— with singing, dancing, ceremonies, fires, and feasts. It’s a day to toast fertility and hope for plentiful harvests. It’s one worth celebrating. And what better way to celebrate than with an EXTENSIVE DETAILS BULLETIN? (I’m joking, please go outside after reading this). I have so much to tell you. This is the first official bulletin from the Solar Institute, by the way. These may come every week or two weeks, depending on how I feel… Anyway. I have some major shit to announce so I gotta keep this moving. The album comes out August 20. It contains 12 songs and 2 bonus tracks.\"\n\nOn July 19, 2021, Lorde’s website updated once again and revealed that the second single, Stoned at the Nail Salon, would release two days later, on July 21, 2021.\n\nThe third single, Mood Ring, was released three days before the album’s release, on August 17, 2021.\n\nOn September 9, 2021, Lorde released Te Ao Mārama, an EP that acts as a companion piece to Solar Power, where she sings 5 of the songs in te reo Māori, an indigenous language of New Zealand.\n\nIts deluxe version was released digitally on November 5, 2021, containing two new tracks that had already been included in the music box: Helen of Troy and Hold No Grudge.\n\nThe album performed middling compared to her previous albums. It debuted at #1 in her native New Zealand, #2 in the UK and #3 in the US, with 75,000 copies in its first week. The album also debuted on the charts in Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands and other countries. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/Solar+Power\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The record received general acclaim from music critics, who praised its overall production and compared its musical style to works by Sky Ferreira, Florence & the Machine and Lana Del Rey. The release peaked at number two in New Zealand and Australia. In the US, the record charted at number 23 on the Billboard 200 chart and has sold 60,000 copies. To promote The Love Club EP, Lorde performed during various concerts and released \"Royals\" as the only single from the EP. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lorde/The+Love+Club+EP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is largely produced by a frequent collaborator of Carti's, Pi'erre Bourne. The cover art for Die Lit was shot by Nick Walker, who wanted to recreate the photo of an old punk rock concert to match the album's aesthetic.\n\nDie Lit is considered an album that changed the trap production style and still a big influence to others hip-hop/rap artists. The album debuted at No. 3 on the US Billboard 200, and Shoota debuted at No. 46 on the US Billboard Hot 100. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Die+Lit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The title refers to Carti’s affiliation with the Bloods, as well as his affinity for Wockhardt’s red codeine-promethazine syrup, commonly known as lean.\n\nIn a Spring 2019 GQ story published on March 4, Carti named fashion designer and art director Virgil Abloh as the creative director of the album.\n\nIn The FADER’s Summer 2019 cover story featuring Carti which was published on June 12, it was revealed that some tracks recorded during the production of the album had guest appearances from Trippie Redd and Gunna, with production from Pi'erre Bourne, Maaly Raw, Richie Souf, Roark Bailey, and Don Cannon.\n\nDuring his performance at The Rave / Eagles Club on July 28, 2019, Carti announced that he was trying to release the album within the following sixty days with no guest appearances:\n\n\"I’m trying to drop that shit in the next 60 days. I ain’t gon' lie, it feel like we worked too hard for this moment so I'ma do this shit with no features.\"  In which Carti did not follow through, since Whole Lotta Red has features with artists such as Kanye West, Future, and Kid Cudi.\n\nIn an interview with Culture Kings released on January 15, 2020, Carti updated the planned release date to 2020:\n\n\"I’m ready. I’m more ready than y'all. I’m trying to prove to these folks that I can’t rap. I got bars. That’s what Whole Lotta Red is about.\"\n\n“@ MEH” was released as a single for the album on April 16, 2020. But the track was later scrapped due to bad reviews on the song from critics.\n\nOn November 23, 2020, Carti shared on Instagram that the album had been turned in to his label.\n\nOn December 11, 2020, DJ Akademiks said during a live stream that Kanye West and Matthew Williams were executive producers of the album. Moreover, he shared that the album would drop on Christmas Day, which was later confirmed by some of Carti’s associates on December 14, 2020. Red graffiti tags subsequently surfaced around the United States with the album's release date.\n\nOn December 21, 2020, Carti revealed the cover artwork and official Christmas Day release date through social media.\n\nWhole Lotta Red, despite releasing with mostly negative opinions, debuted at no. 1 on the US Billboard 200 with over 100,000 units sold and received 160 million global streams within its first week. Soon enough, the album later started to gain appreciation from critics and now is considered a groundbreaking album of the aggressive, punk-inspired, hip-hop/rap genre. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Playboi+Carti/Whole+Lotta+Red\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

According to Pitchfork, “Pretty Girl” is a song about changing for a relationship and losing yourself along the way.\n\nThe song was originally recorded on GarageBand for a cassette compilation that was limited to 250 copies.\n\n\"I’m still not entirely sure how “Pretty Girl” blew up the way it did. It wasn’t really meant to. The song was originally meant for a compilation tape for a magazine called The Le Sigh, and I made the video in about 30 minutes. I only expected about 5,000 views at most! Getting a million views on a video I made is still hard for me to wrap my head around. Most of my friends back home still have no idea that any of this has happened.\" - via Pigeons & Planes\n\n\"the reason I made this music video was to actually help myself. on the day i made this, my hair was greasy, my skin was bad, i had nothing to wear, and i didn’t want to leave bed. i had just woken up in this video and you can definitely tell (lol) i felt really ugly but realized that it’s perfectly okay to feel that way/have those types of days.\nthe song is about a relationship i had where i felt I needed to be the perfect girl for another person.. whether that’s wearing makeup, doing my hair, wearing things they like, or even changing the way i speak/WHEN i speak.\n\nso, i felt that the only way i could make this video was to have a lot of fun looking disgusting and not caring at all ! it’s okay to have flaws and it’s okay to embrace them and it’s okay to be silly and stupid. you all might already know this, but i’m happy that i know this now\"\n\n– Clairo via YouTube <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clairo/Pretty+Girl\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Minutes later, a second teaser was released.\n\nA music video for the single was accompanied with the single’s release. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Miley+Cyrus/Flowers\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Freddie replaced lead vocalist Tim Staffell, after the latter's departure from the original trio. \n\nThere was much deliberation as to what the band's name would be. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

Combined with Greatest Hits II, it became the definitive Queen compilation. While a domestic release with different tracks but the same cover art was available in the U.S. in 1981, the British release was available to United States customers only by import until the 1995 release of Greatest Hits I & II, which combined the two discs. The seventeen-track UK Greatest Hits disc was released in the U.S. on its own for the first time, with a few bonus tracks, in 2004 under the name Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition.\n\nThere was no universal track listing or cover art for the Greatest Hits album, and each territory's tracks were dependent on what singles were released there and what tracks charted. In some cases, despite the band's popularity, not enough songs were issued as singles to fill a compilation album, and a few album tracks were used as filler. Some examples of these were \"Sweet Lady\" and \"Love of My Life\", neither was released as a single in any country, but appear on some regions' 1981 Hits release. In the UK and the U.S., where solid numbers could be collected, the standard was raised again by only including top twenty Hits.\n\nThe U.S. ended up with its original edit of Queen's first single release, \"Keep Yourself Alive\", which had been re-released in the U.S. in 1975 (original release was 1973) after the success of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\". Also, because of the delay in release dates between the UK (out first) and the U.S. (almost a month later), the U.S. was able to add \"Under Pressure\" (Queen's duet with David Bowie) to its Hits collection, as it was released during that interim.\n\nIn Argentina and Brazil, the LP edition included the same list of UK Greatest Hits minus \"Seven Seas of Rhye\", and including \"Love of My Life\" (Live Killers version). CD version is the same as the British.\n\nJumping ahead to 1991, Queen sought to issue a second Greatest Hits collection worldwide, this time with a standard track listing. However, the band had just changed record labels in the US, from Capitol to Hollywood Records, who keen on a massive promotion of the band's back catalogue. The problem was that Elektra still held the US rights to that first 1981 collection (despite being Hollywood's US licencée). Hollywood Records decided to not release Greatest Hits II to the U.S. market, but instead created their own collection, Classic Queen (1992). This compilation was made up of tracks such as \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", \"Keep Yourself Alive\" and \"Under Pressure\" (which had already appeared on the Elektra 1981 Hits collection) as well as newer tracks (\"A Kind of Magic\" and \"Radio Ga Ga\"). Some tracks were not even singles in the U.S. (\"One Year of Love\") or anywhere (\"Stone Cold Crazy\"). Though well received, this collection would eventually pose the problem of overlapping track lists in the future.\n\nHollywood Records, later that year, re-released a companion collection Greatest Hits with similar artwork (on a red background, where Classic Queen was on royal blue). Commonly referred to as the Red Greatest Hits, it features most of the '70s tracks absent from \"Classic Queen\" (including \"Another One Bites the Dust\" , \"We Will Rock You\", \"We Are the Champions\" and \"Killer Queen\").\n\nIn 2004, to promote the Las Vegas production of the musical \"We Will Rock You\", Hollywood Records released Greatest Hits: We Will Rock You Edition which was the UK Greatest Hits with three bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Queen/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The fourth single, a collaboration with Diplo called “Daylight,” was released on August 6, 2020.\n\nThe album takes a sonically different approach from \"BALLADS 1\", with a sound that’s less focused on Joji’s typical melancholy, lo-fi sound. Instead, the album takes a mix of many retroelements instrumentation from older Joji projects that never got to see the light of streaming services. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Joji/Nectar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A two-sided hit single from the album, \"Something\" backed with \"Come Together\", released in October, topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US.\n\nAbbey Road is a rock album that incorporates genres such as blues, pop, and progressive rock, and it makes prominent use of the Moog synthesizer and the Leslie speaker. Side two contains a medley of song fragments edited together to form a single piece. The album was recorded amid a more enjoyable atmosphere than the \"Get Back/Let It Be\" sessions earlier in the year, but there were still frequent disagreements within the band. John Lennon had privately left the group by the time the album was released and McCartney publicly quit the following year.\n\nAbbey Road is widely regarded as one of The Beatles' most tightly constructed albums, although the band was barely operating as a functioning unit at the time. Despite the tensions within the band, Abbey Road was released to near universal acclaim and is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. In 2012, Abbey Road was voted 14th on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2009, readers of the magazine also named Abbey Road the greatest Beatles album.\n\nAlthough Abbey Road was an immediate commercial success and reached  No. 1 in the UK and US, it initially received mixed reviews, some critics describing its music as inauthentic and bemoaning the production's artificial effects. Over time, the album became viewed as among the Beatles' best and many critics have ranked it as one of the greatest albums of all time. In particular, George Harrison's contributions, \"Something\" and \"Here Comes the Sun\", are considered to be among the best songs he wrote for the group. The album's cover, which features the four band members walking across a zebra crossing outside Abbey Road Studios, has become one of the most famous and imitated images in the history of popular music. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Abbey+Road+(Remastered)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album features virtually every number-one single the band achieved in the United Kingdom and the United States from 1962 to 1970. Issued on the 30th anniversary of the band's break-up, it was their first compilation available on only one CD. 1 was a commercial success and topped the charts worldwide. It has sold over 31 million copies.\n\nIn addition, 1 is the fourth best-selling album in the US since Nielsen Sound Scan began tracking US album sales in January 1991 and the best-selling album of the decade (2000 to 2009) in the US, as well as the best-selling album of the decade worldwide. 1 was remastered and reissued in September 2011 and was remixed and reissued again in several different deluxe editions in November 2015, the most comprehensive of which is a three-disc set entitled 1+, which includes video discs of the band's music videos.\n\nAs of June 2015, 1 is the sixth best-selling album of the 21st century in the UK, having sold over 3.1 million copies.\n\nBackground:\nCompiled by producer George Martin and the (then) three surviving members of the band, 1 includes the 27 Beatles songs that went to number one in the United Kingdom on the Record Retailer Top 50 chart or in the United States on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. It is worth noting, however, that the song \"For You Blue\" was listed on Billboard chart at number 1, along with the A-side \"The Long and Winding Road\", but Capitol Records treated \"For You Blue\" as strictly a B-side and did not promote it as an A-side. Meanwhile, \"Day Tripper\" was included on 1, since it charted at number 1 in the UK as a double A-side with \"We Can Work It Out,\" while in the US, only \"We Can Work It Out\" was number 1. Two notable singles released in both the UK and the US that did not reach number 1 in either country, and were therefore ineligible for inclusion on the album, were \"Please Please Me\" and \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" (both reached number 2 in the UK charts, while in the US the former peaked at number 3, and the latter at number 8). The former was largely known as \"The Beatles' first UK number one single\"; however, it reached the top spot in the musical magazines New Musical Express and Melody Maker but not on the chart published by Record Retailer (now Music Week). On the other hand, \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" was part of a double A-side single along with \"Penny Lane.\" This single had peaked at number 2 in the charts, behind Engelbert Humperdinck's single \"Release Me.\"\n\nThis album is essentially a combination of both the US and UK versions of the earlier album 20 Greatest Hits, with the addition of \"Something\" (which was left off 20 Greatest Hits because of time constraints). On 1, \"Hey Jude\" was released in its original full-length version (slightly over seven minutes); on the American version of 20 Greatest Hits it had been released as a shortened version.\n\nRemastering:\nBefore 1, all 27 songs were available mainly in two remastered CD versions. First, on the respective Beatles albums released in 1987 (as well as Past Masters, Volume One and Past Masters, Volume Two, released in 1988). The second remastering was made available on the CD versions for 1962–1966 and 1967–1970 (released in 1993).\n\nThe songs on 1 were remastered specifically for the release in 2000. According to the liner notes of the album, the original analog masters were \"digitally remastered at 24 bits resolution, processed using Sonic Solutions NoNoise technology and mastered to 16 bit using Prism SNS Noise Shaping.\" The remastering was overseen by Peter Mew of Abbey Road Studios and took place there. In 2011, 1 was remastered and reissued on CD. In 2015 it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin when Martin began to assist with fixing up the audio tracks for the 1+ video clips, he realized that his goal of making them “more immersive” should also apply to 1. For the remixing project, the remasters went back to the final mix tapes, remastered them, cleaned them up and then EQ-ed them and released them. About the remastering, Martin commented: \"My approach was to be respectful of everything, I had sessions and sessions where I flipped between previously remastered stereos, the mono remasters, and the remixes we’ve done. I flip between everything and make sure I prefer what we’ve done.\"\n\nPackage:\nThe package of 1 was intended to be simplistic and ambitious at the same time. Its cover was designed by Rick Ward and consists of a pop-art yellow number one on a red background. The emphasis on the 1 digit was used on many of the compilations of number-one hits by different artists that followed this album; for example, ELV1S by Elvis Presley or Number Ones by the Bee Gees. The album's back cover features the famous photos of the Beatles taken by Richard Avedon and copyrighted on 17 August 1967. The design exclusively uses variations of the Helvetica typeface.\n\n1 was released worldwide in CD and cassette. The vinyl format was released in only the United Kingdom. The CD includes a 32-page booklet with a colored page with international picture covers (a total of 163 covers are displayed on the whole booklet) and details (recording date, location, release date, chart stats) for each of the singles. It also includes on its first two pages a collage with 27 1s in different colours (all of them following the same art as the cover) with the sentence \"27 No. 1 singles = 1\" (which was used as a catch phrase for the promo ads for the album), and a foreword by George Martin.\n\nThe LP and cassette keep the main part of the CD version, but in a different form. The double vinyl record version was not released in the US, but the imported British edition was available. The vinyl version features a large full-color fold-out poster showing 126 picture sleeves (37 fewer than on the CD), and reproductions of the four Richard Avedon photos. The Avedon portraits also appear on the inside of the gatefold cover. The records have custom labels featuring the same graphics as the front cover and are packaged in custom inner sleeves. The deluxe packaging of the vinyl album, with its four portraits and poster, is reminiscent to that of their titular 1968 album. The cassette included a 20-page insert, including the college, the George Martin commentary and paged Avedon's portraits on its inlay and the whole description for the tracks as a total of 36 covers on its inlay reverse.\n\nRelease variations\n2000 CD.

Apple 06025 475678 1 9 (as 1+ with two DVD or Blu-ray discs)\n\nOn 6 November 2015, Apple Records released a deluxe version of the original album, titled 1+. Most of the tracks on 1 have been remixed from the original multi-track masters by Giles Martin, except the first three tracks, which are the original mono mixes. In addition to the new mixes, there are surround sound 5.1 mixes presented as Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio in the Blu-ray version and Dolby Digital and DTS in the DVD version.\n\n1+ also includes 50 promotional films/performances, plus commentary and introductions from Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. All the videos have been digitally restored and enhanced. They are available on DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nVariations of 1/1+ include standard CD, CD/DVD, CD/Blu-ray, CD/2DVD, CD/2Blu-ray. The double-disc video editions also feature a 124-page hard-bound book with illustrations. The DVD/Blu-ray video editions are also available as a stand-alone package.\n\nReception\nProfessional ratings\nReview scores\nSource    Rating\nAllMusic    5/5 stars\nNME    9/10\nQ    4/5 stars\nMelody Maker    5/5 stars\n1 received universal acclaim. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic gave the album five stars out of five. He stated that there is \"no question that this is all great music,\" although to him \"there's really no reason for anyone who owns all the records to get this too.\"\n\nLegacy:\n1 would go on to inspire the release of a wave of compilation albums, in particular, three other \"number ones\" albums – Elvis Presley's ELV1S (2002), Michael Jackson's Number Ones (2003) and the Bee Gees' ELV1SNumber Ones (2004). Other compilations issued in its wake included Pink Floyd's 2-CD retrospective Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd, Nirvana's Nirvana (2002), The Rolling Stones' Forty Licks (2002), The Who's The Ultimate Collection (2002), and Dean Martin's Dino: The Essential Dean Martin (2004).\n\nSales and chart performance:\nThe reception of 1 surpassed all critical and commercial expectations. It reached number 1 in over 35 countries, achieving the record for the album debuting at the top of the national charts ever. It became the highest-selling of 2000 and, sometime later, of the entire decade. This achievement made the Beatles the first and only artist to have the best-selling albums of two different decades. They also had the best-selling album of the 1960s, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. No tracks from Sgt. Pepper appear on this album. With this album, the Beatles also achieved having an album hit the number 1 position in the US in four non-consecutive decades (the 1960s, 1970s, 1990s, and 2000s).\n\nIn the United Kingdom, 1 became the Beatles' 15th number 1 album with sales of 319,126 copies (achieving record sales for only one week in 2000). On 18 December 2000, Ananova.com reported that the album has \"become 2000's biggest-selling album—in only five weeks.\" 1 was the first album to stay at the top spot for nine weeks in almost ten years (the last being the Eurythmics's Greatest Hits), the best-selling album of 2000, and the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s so far in the UK. In its eleventh week, 1 sold a total of two million copies in the UK. It spent a total of 46 weeks inside the Top 75. In July 2013 it was certified 10× platinum by the BPI, for over 3 million copies sold in the UK. It is the 21st best-selling album in the UK—according to an assessment by the Official Charts Company and the British Phonographic Industry that counted album sales in the UK from 28 July 1956 to the present day—, and the second best-selling Beatles album in that country (only beaten by Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which is the UK's third best-selling album). As of July 2016, the album has sold over 3,230,000 copies in the UK.\n\nIn the United States, the response was similar. 1 debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 during the week of December 2, 2000, with sales totaling over 595,500 copies. In its second week, sales increased to 662,000 but Backstreet Boys' Black & Blue, which sold 1.59 million units, knocked it off the top spot, therefore, 1 fell off to number two on its week on the chart. The following week it stayed at number two selling 607,000 units, by doing so, the album became the sixth to debut at the top of the Billboard 200 and post a SoundScan increase in its second week and the first to do so after opening with a sum of more than half a million copies. During the week of December 23, 2000, its fourth week on the chart, 1 moved 671,000 copies and returned to the top of the Billboard 200. The next week, on December 30, 2000, it stayed at the top of the chart selling 823,500 copies. On February 10, 2001, after being the number one album for eight nonconsecutive weeks, 1 fell off to number four on the Billboard 200 with 173,500 units sold, a 19.5% dip in sales, by the time this happened the album had sold almost six million units. The album spent a total of eight weeks at number 1 and sold 1,258,667 copies during the week before Christmas of 2000. With this number, the Beatles achieved a new record: it was the seventh highest one-week sales in Soundscan history, the highest for an album not in its first week of sales, and the highest for an album comprising previously released music. The album spent 309 weeks inside the Billboard 200 and was the sixth best-selling album in the United States in 2000 with 5,100,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan. On August 30, 2011, the band announced through their Facebook account that the album was available to pre-order from iTunes and that it was digitally remastered. On September 24, 2011, after the album made its digital debut in the iTunes Store it re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number four selling 60,000 units, it also topped the iTunes album charts in the US, Canada, Japan, the Netherlands, Mexico, Switzerland, Spain, New Zealand, and Greece according to a Capitol/EMI press release. Its digital launch on the iTunes Store was accompanied by a price of $9.99 and a Twitter camping with the hashtag #MyBeatles1 asking their fans: What is your favorite \"1\" track? Resulting in many celebrities and stars posting their favorites, too. In 2015, after it was remastered again and remixed by Giles Martin, 1 re-entered on the Billboard 200 at number six selling 40,000 units. It was certified eleven times platinum by the RIAA on March 8, 2010, denoting shipments of eleven million units, and 1 is included on the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Recording Industry Association of America. The album is the best-selling album of the 21st century in the US and the fourth best-selling album in the Soundscan era (1991–present). As of February 2014, the album has had sold 12,410,000 copies in the US. In the US, the album secured the Beatles a fourth decade in which they placed an album at number 1 on the Billboard chart.\n\nIn Canada, 1 debuted at number 1 on the Canadian Albums Chart, selling 54,668 copies in its first week. The album was certified Diamond (1,000,000 units) by the CRIA in February 2001, just four months after its release. As of 2009, 1 has sold 1,103,000 units in Canada, making it the fifth best-selling album ever in Canada of the Nielsen SoundScan era.\n\nIn Germany, 1 debuted at number 1 and managed to stay there nine non-consecutive weeks. Though this, it stayed only seventeen weeks in the top ten of the German Albums Chart, fifty weeks in the total chart. By selling 1,650,000 copies and reaching 11× Gold, it's the third best-selling album of the decade 2000–2009 and the best-selling non-German language album.\n\nIn 2009, Apple Corps, the Beatles' company, stated that worldwide sales of 1 had exceeded 31 million copies. Worldwide in 2000 the album sold 13.8 million copies, with 2 million or more copies sold during 2 consecutive weeks, and was the fourth best-selling album behind Eminem's The Marshall Mathers LP, Britney Spears' Oops!... I Did It Again, and Santana's Supernatural.\n\nTracklisting:\nLennon–McCartney wrote all songs, except \"Something\" by George Harrison, and those others as noted on the second DVD.

                    "content": "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth album by British rock band The Beatles. It was recorded with breaks from the end of 1966 to the middle of 1967 and published on June 14, 1967. The producer was George Martin, and the studio engineer was Geoff Emerick. Most critics agree with the choice of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine, according to which this is the greatest rock album of all time. This album also has the most famous cover in rock history.\n\nReleased on 26 May 1967, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the Record Retailer chart in the United Kingdom and 15 weeks at number one on the Billboard Top LPs chart in the United States. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in songwriting, production, and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for reflecting the interests of contemporary youth and the counterculture. Its release was a defining moment in 1960s pop culture, heralding the Summer of Love, while the album's reception achieved full cultural legitimization for pop music and recognition for the medium as a genuine art form.\n\nAt the end of August 1966, the Beatles permanently retired from touring and pursued individual interests for the next three months. During a return flight to London in November, Paul McCartney had an idea for a song involving an Edwardian military band that formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. Sessions began on 24 November at EMI Studios with compositions inspired by the Beatles' youth, but after pressure from EMI, the songs \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" and \"Penny Lane\" were released as a double A-side single in February 1967 and left off the LP.\n\nThe album was loosely conceptualized as a performance by the fictional Sgt. Pepper band, an idea that was conceived after recording the title track. A key work of British psychedelia, it incorporates a range of stylistic influences, including vaudeville, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. The band continued the technological experimentation marked by their previous album, Revolver, this time without an absolute deadline for completion. With producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick, the group colored much of the recordings with sound effects and tape manipulation, as exemplified on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\" \"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\" and \"A Day in the Life.\" The recording was completed on 21 April. The pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth designed the cover, which depicts the Beatles posing in front of a tableau of celebrities and historical figures.\n\nMusicologists regard Sgt. Pepper was an early concept album that advanced the roles of sound composition, extended form, psychedelic imagery, record sleeves, and the producer in popular music. The album had an immediate cross-generational impact and was associated with numerous touchstones of the era's youth culture, such as fashion, drugs, mysticism, and a sense of optimism and empowerment. It is considered one of the first art rock LPs, a progenitor to progressive rock, and the start of the album era. In 1968, it won four Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honor; in 2003, the Library of Congress inducted it into the National Recording Registry. It has topped several critics' and listeners' polls for the best album of all time, including those published by Rolling Stone magazine and in the book All-Time Top 1000 Albums, and the UK's \"Music of the Millennium\" poll. It remains one of the best-selling albums of all time and the UK's best-selling studio album, with more than 32 million copies sold worldwide as of 2011.\n\nThe beginning of the psychedelic era:\nAfter giving up the rock tour in August 1966, the Beatles' popularity began to decline sharply, and the media began to speculate that the band had \"dried up\" under the onslaught of a new generation of rock artists, primarily genre-oriented psychedelic rock. A type of rock and roll that is produced under the influence of hallucinogenic drugs, primarily LSD.\n\nThe Beatles have used these drugs before, but their impact on their music has not been overly pronounced (except for a few songs from the Revolver album, including the group's first psychedelic song, Tomorrow Never Knows). In February 1967, at the urging of manager Brian Epstein, the Beatles released the single Strawberry Fields Forever / Penny Lane, with songs originally planned for their next LP album. The single took second place on the charts and after several years; it was characterized as a failure. However, after this, the group did not leave the studio for several months.\n\nStudy work:\nWith the permission of producer George Martin to use certain amounts of drugs in the studio, the Beatles were led by Paul McCartney for the first time, because the former frontman, John Lennon, was depressed due to family problems. McCartney was the author of most of the songs on the album (including the title songs), however, Lennon also significantly contributed to this project with songs such as Being for Benefits of Mr. Kite and A Day in the Life, part of which was recorded by McCartney for his own song, but Martin added it to Lennon. All the songs of these two were later, by an earlier agreement, marked traditionally - Lennon / McCartney, but each author is the lead vocalist in his song, except in the case of the song \"With a Little Help of My Friends,\" sung by the drummer, Ringo Starr. As for the studio technique, the previous 4-channel recording machine, ADT (Auto Double-Tracking) machine for doubling one's voice was used. In the coming period, this machine will be more and more popular, as the individuality of the members grows in the group, who will want to record most or even their entire songs on their own.\n\nCover:\nAccording to various sources, the cover was also McCartney's idea. The Beatles, in guard uniforms, with wind instruments, for the first time with a mustache and beard, are an integral part of all versions of this album. However, in the American edition, that is where it all ends, because there is only a yellow wall behind the group. In the British  (European) edition, behind The Beatles there is a bunch of people, important in the then and past time - among them are Albert Einstein, Karl Marx, Marilyn Monroe, ... However, The Beatles themselves with the look of before this album. Also, below the members of the group is a floral decor with the inscription \"The Beatles\". An album like this was a lure for many conspiracy theorists, so this is also one of the most mysterious covers of all time.\n\nThe final concept:\nThe whole album is connected by one theme, which was a kind of precedent and thus The Beatles became the creators of the so-called Concept album. The protagonist of the story in question is a certain Billy Shears (when, thanks to the fact that he lent his voice in the song \"With a Little Help of My Friends,\" interpreted by Ringo Starr), who modestly announces a performance after the pompous performance of the Sergeant Pepper Club more \"lonely hearts,\" claiming that \"a little help from a friend\" is enough for him after a hard day. Then, in the following songs, the Beatles comment on various existential problems - from a normal working day (\"Good Morning, Good Morning\"), old age (\"When I'm 64\") to death itself and the problems around it (\"Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds\"). The album closes with a slightly modified (\"reprise\") version of the first song, which builds on the last song --  \"A Day in the Life\" -- which features multiple crescendos. The whole album is accompanied by studio applause from the audience and applause. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Beatles/Sgt.+Pepper%27s+Lonely+Hearts+Club+Band\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was produced primarily by Hector Delgado and A$AP Rocky himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers.\nTESTING was supported by two singles: “A$AP Forever“ and “Praise the Lord (Da Shine)“, alongside numerous promotional singles. The album received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number four on the US Billboard 200, earning 75,000 album-equivalent units of which 13,000 were pure sales, becoming A$AP Rocky's third consecutive top-five album on the chart.\nOn October 16, 2019, TESTING was certified gold by the RIAA for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units in the United States.\n\nIn September 2017, A$AP Rocky announced the release of a new album, originally scheduled for a late 2017 release. The previous month, A$AP Rocky released Cozy Tapes Vol. 2: Too Cozy as part of the rap collective A$AP Mob.\nIn January 2018, the album's title was cryptically left under SoundCloud song descriptions, until being officially confirmed in May 2018. In an interview with GQ, Rocky stated: \"My new album is really about testing new sounds. People are scared to test new sounds, so they go with what's current 'cause it's the easy thing to do. The top 100 songs sound a certain way. People cater more to that because it's a bigger demographic behind that, or it's a guaranteed demographic behind that. I prefer to experiment and have my crowd grow with me and to reach new crowds. I don't just rap—I actually make music. That's why it takes time. These sonics represent me.\"\nThe album artwork was unveiled on May 21, 2018, featuring a photo by Houston-based creative director Cary Fagan. The tracklist was announced three days later. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/A$AP+Rocky/TESTING\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Cole’s sixth studio album and his first release of 2021.\n\nOn August 7, 2018, Cole released a freestyle titled “Album of the Year,” as a promotional single for the album. Its release doubled as the announcement of the LP. In both the SoundCloud and music video description, Cole writes:\n\n\"The Off Season coming soon… All roads lead to The Fall Off\"\n\nThe beginning of the “Album of the Year” music video references The Off-Season:\n\nThe artwork for “Album of the Year” also contained references to The Off-Season.\n\nCole continued to tease the album on November 9, 2018, when he created a Spotify playlist called “Where the fuck is The Off Season,” which, at the time, included many of his 2018 features and a few solo songs (it has been constantly updated).\n\nOn July 22, 2020, J. Cole released Lewis Street, a two-track release that included “Lion King on Ice” and “t h e . c l i m b . b a c k.” While they both were intended to be the lead singles to The Fall Off, it was revealed days before The Off-Season’s release that the latter would appear on the LP, therefore making “t h e . c l i m b . b a c k” the lead single to the album.\n\nOn December 29, 2020, Cole reignited the desire for The Off-Season when he posted a schedule of what he deemed “The Fall Off Era.” The calendar begins with two completed events, Cole’s famous feature run and Revenge of the Dreamers III, and they are followed by The Off-Season.\n\nAfter the album’s imminent release, the calendar lists (seemingly) the birth of Cole’s third son and the release of The Fall Off.\n\nOn April 28, Bas made an Instagram post alleging that Cole had completed The Off-Season and that it would be released in “two weeks” (he later deleted the post). Two days later, Cole posted on his Instagram story that he had “just rode through the city to The Off-Season,” both proclaiming his excitement for its release and confirming the legitimacy of Bas’ post.\n\nOn May 4, 2021, Cole revealed the release date and artwork for The Off-Season.\n\nOn May 7, Cole released the album’s second single, “​i n t e r l u d e.” Three days later, he premiered Applying Pressure: The Off-Season, a succinct documentary about the album’s creative process and concept.\n\nLater that day, it was announced that Cole had signed a deal to play with Rwanda’s Patriots BBC in the Basketball Africa League. This seemed to be the intentional culmination of Cole’s storied work on developing a basketball career, so his reignited journey in the sport correlates directly to the idea and concept of The Off-Season.\n\nOn the 11th, Cole was officially unveiled as the first solo artist to grace the cover of SLAM magazine. In his cover interview, Cole spoke on a few aspects of his life and explained the concepts of both this LP and its successor, The Fall Off.\n\nOn the 13th, eight hours before its release, Cole revealed the album’s tracklist and producer list. Upon the album’s release, it was unveiled that it featured vocal contributions from 21 Savage, Bas, Morray, 6LACK, Cam'ron, and Lil Baby, amongst others. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/J.+Cole/The+Off-Season\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Three songs from Wild were selected to be on the standard edition of the album, while all six songs are also available on the deluxe edition.\n\nThe day following the announcement, Sivan extended his first U.S. tour Troye Sivan Live to a world tour with legs in Europe and Australia. Pre-orders for the album opened on 15 October 2015, with the album reaching No. 1 within hours on iTunes in ten countries, including the United States.\n\n\"TALK ME DOWN\" was included as a promotional single to those who preorder the album and was the only previously unreleased song made available before release. Those who had already purchased Wild received a discount to purchase Blue Neighbourhood. Sivan also launched merchandise bundles on his site, selling jumpers with the album logo, candles scented to match the mood of his songs, CDs, vinyl, posters, digital downloads, bags, and notebooks.\n \"YOUTH\" was released as the third single from the album. The song premiered exclusively on November 12 on Shazam Top 20 at 7PM AEST and was officially released worldwide after midnight in each country on November 13.\n\nBlue Neighbourhood received positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Everett True from The Guardian gave the album five stars, calling it \"difficult to find fault with Blue Neighbourhood\" and praising Sivan for \"capturing the sound of now so well\". James Reed from The Boston Globe found the album to be \"darkly seductive\" but \"riddled with coming-of-age anxiety.\" Rolling Stone Australia gave the album four stars, describing the album to be \"charming\" and praising Sivan's vocals.\n\nBernard Zuel from The Sydney Morning Herald described Sivan as having a \"coffee-and-cream voice artfully caught between childhood and adulthood.\" Jody Rosen from News Corp Australia praised the lyrical content of the songs, which do not obscure Sivan's sexuality, stating \"Sivan does not shy away from pronouns. He's fearless and honest in a way most pop stars aren’t.\" Rosen compares Sivan's mellow voice with artists such as Lorde and Lana Del Rey. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Troye+Sivan/Blue+Neighbourhood+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With My World peaking at number five that week, he became the first artist to occupy two top-five positions since Nelly in 2004.

It also charted in the top ten of fifteen other countries.

Allmusic writer John Bush gave it four out of five stars and compared the album to its predecessors, describing it as \"somewhere between the two, closer to the vitality and energy of the original but not without the crossover bids and guest features of the latter (albeit much better this time)\". Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly commented that the album succeeds at its goal of \"reaching maximum commercial blast radius while maintaining its street bona fides\". Steve Jones of USA Today praised Jay-Z's lyricism and wrote that he \"shows that for someone who is measured mostly against himself, lyrical dexterity doesn't have an expiration date\". The Daily Telegraph gave the album four out of five stars and complimented its modern sound. The A.V. Club gave it a B+ rating and stated \"Jay-Z sounds liberated by his legacy rather than weighed down by expectations\".\nHowever, Slant Magazine's William McBee found The Blueprint 3 \"predictable\" and \"complacent\", stating \"The album is a hip-hop feast, for sure, filled to the brim with elite production and elite rapping, but it lacks the hungriness, the spirit, and the craziness that marks a classic album\". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the album three out of five stars and wrote that it \"peters out in a mass of indistinct tracks\" following its first four songs. Andrew Martin of PopMatters gave it a five out of 10 rating and viewed its second half as weak, stating \"Jigga has the ability to push the envelope and make fantastic music. But on here, he has clearly reached an impasse of how to execute that perfectly\". Pitchfork Media's Ian Cohen commented that it is \"so certainly Jay-Z's weakest solo album, you'll be tempted to wonder if Kingdom Come was somehow underrated\". The Washington Post's Chris Richards gave the album a negative review and criticized its lyrical content, \"pairing bromidic couplets with swatches of keyboard piffle\". In his review for the Los Angeles Times, critic Greg Kot gave the album two-and-a-half out of four stars and viewed Jay-Z's celebrity and older age as somewhat of a flaw, stating:\nIt's tough for hip-hop stars to age well. Once they become celebrities living in mansions and starring in family movies, street cred is usually the first thing to go. Just ask Ice Cube. Longevity just wasn't built into the hip-hop lifestyle, with its premium on youthful swagger, street tales and fast turnover  'The Blueprint 3' aims to show everyone he still has wicked skills on the mike. It does, even as it illustrates that sometimes he coasts on his celebrity  The message: Don't mess with ol' Gray-Z. Charles Aaron of Spin criticized the album's production and commented that \"it's got its highs and lows\". Rolling Stone's Jody Rosen called it \"a catchy, pop-friendly record\", but viewed that it lacks the \"electric charge\" of Jay-Z's previous albums and that he is \"stuck for a subject  But he says it well\". Stephen Dalton of The Times gave the album three out of five stars and called it \"no great milestone, but far from the predicted disaster.\" Despite noting inconsistency in Jay-Z's rapping, Jon Caramanica of The New York Times complimented the album's varied musical elements and called it \"an unexpected blend of maturity and youth\". Pete Cashmore of NME gave it an eight out of 10 rating and wrote that it \"delivers because of hefty beats and quality rapsmanship, nothing else. And, ultimately, that’ll do just fine\". Kiilian Fox of The Observer commented that Jay-Z is \"maturing into a responsible elder statesman\". Zach Baron of The Village Voice viewed that \"much of Blueprint 3 is about the weird, meta-rap work of redefining what it is to be a boss\" and stated \"Jay-Z's midlife crisis is over. Which doesn't make The Blueprint 3 a classic. But we'll take it. For now\".\n\nThe Blueprint 3 was ranked the best album of the year by Billboard, and seventh best album of the year by MTV. Rolling Stone named it the fourth best album of 2009 in its year-end list. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/The+Blueprint+3\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A cappella-only version of \"The Black Album\" featuring these performances was also released.\n\nIn early interviews, Jay-Z said that the album would be a return to his Reasonable Doubt sound (responding to criticism from some fans that his subsequent efforts were too commercial) and that it would be \"for the streets\", with no promotion or singles, however, \"Change Clothes\" and \"Dirt Off Your Shoulder\" were both successful singles.\n\nHe also claimed that the album would have a different producer for each track, and early magazine advertisements listed a series of numbers (representing tracks) and a producer for each number. The final album did feature a variety of producers, although Roc-A-Fella producers Kanye West and Just Blaze produced two tracks each, in addition to the two produced by frequent Jay-Z collaborators The Neptunes. Longtime collaborators DJ Premier and Dr. Dre did not produce any tracks. 9th Wonder saw a boost in popularity after producing \"Threat\" for the album. (Jay-Z is credited as the second producer on the track for finding the R. Kelly sample that was included in the beat.) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/The+Black+Album\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Contrasting the radio-friendly sound of Jay-Z's previous work, The Blueprint features soul-based sampling and production handled primarily by Kanye West and Just Blaze. At the time of its recording, Jay-Z was awaiting two criminal trials, one for gun possession and another for assault, and had become one of hip hop's most dissed artists, receiving insults from rappers such as Nas, Prodigy, and Jadakiss. In spite of its release coinciding with the 9/11 attacks, The Blueprint sold over 420,000 copies in its opening week, becoming Jay-Z's fourth consecutive album to reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. It was certified double platinum as sales stand at over two million units in the U.S.\n\nThe Blueprint is a landmark release in Jay-Z's extensive catalog, and is consistently ranked among the greatest hip-hop albums of all time. Complex Magazine named it the top album of the 2000's and in 2019 The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" It also gave producer Kanye West his big break in the mainstream after years working in the Chicago underground scene.  West produced four of the album's 13 tracks, namely the lead single \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.),\" as well as the infamous Nas diss \"Takeover\" and the soulful favorite \"Heart of the City (Ain't No Love).\" 3 years later Kanye released his instant-classic debut album The College Dropout, which included a verse from Jay on the track \"Never Let Me Down.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/JAY-Z/The+Blueprint\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was produced by Terry Date, who produced the band's first two albums, Adrenaline and Around the Fur. Recording sessions took place between August and December 1999 at Larrabee Sound Studios in West Hollywood and The Plant Recording Studios in Sausalito, California.\n\nThe album marked a significant growth in the band's sound, incorporating influences from post-hardcore, trip-hop, shoegaze, progressive rock, and post-rock into the alternative metal sound which they had become known for. White Pony was also the first recording to feature Frank Delgado as a full-time member of the band on turntables and synthesizer; Delgado had previously worked with the band as a featured guest on their first two albums, producing sound effects on some songs. It was also the first Deftones album which Chino Moreno began to contribute rhythm guitar parts.\n\nAfter a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording White Pony, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno explained that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of \"Change (In the House of Flies)\" was the turning point where the band began working as a group.\n\nDespite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time making the album. Cheng explained that \"We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make.\" Moreno did not have a common theme in mind lyrically, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics, explaining that \"I basically didn’t sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things. Once I did that I was able to sing about anything I wanted to, I could be a lot more general. There’s a lot of stuff on this record that people are going to question me about, and I can just remove myself from it. It’s not me. I’m writing a story here.\"\n\nAlthough the band initially wasn't intending to include guest musicians in the record, the album features additional vocals by Maynard James Keenan on \"Passenger\", Scott Weiland on \"Rx Queen\", and Rodleen Getsic on \"Knife Prty\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/White+Pony\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The latter release date change was possibly due to the album leaking onto the internet two months before the release date in March 2010. The first song released off the album, \"Rocket Skates\", was available for free download through the band's official website on February 23, 2010. The song had been included in Deftones live performances starting in October 2009, and will be released as a limited edition 7\" vinyl single for international Record Store Day on April 17, 2010. The first radio single was the title track, \"Diamond Eyes\", which was released for airplay on March 30, 2010. The single was also was released as a digital download on March 23, 2010.\n\n\"I don't like listening to people's problems - I like music. Music has been smothered with that complaining since the early-'90s. It gets old. Instead of going to the opposite side of the spectrum and listening to Black Eyed Peas, which is just straight silly, I choose to listen to more instrumental music. I do very little singing about myself on this record. I love songs where I can totally take myself out of being human. I can sing about really odd things, and they don't necessarily have to pertain to me at all. It paints a picture. Those are the kind of lyrics I grew up with - like The Cure. Really visual images and no storytelling.\" --- Chino Moreno <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/Diamond+Eyes\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Deftones was the last album produced by Terry Date, who had collaborated with the band since Adrenaline, due to the vast amount of time spent in the studio, for example the band spent the first 3 days hanging around.

It was intended to be the opening track, but the band decided to change the song's title and order at the last minute. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Deftones/Deftones\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\"First Impressions of Earth\" is The Strokes' third studio album, and was released in January 2006 to mixed reviews and debuted at number four in the US and number one in the UK, a first for the band. In Japan it went gold within the first week of release. It was also the most downloaded album for two weeks on iTunes. Fraiture claimed that the album was \"like a scientific breakthrough\". In January 2006, the band then made their second appearance on Saturday Night Live playing \"Juicebox\" and \"You Only Live Once\".\n\nThe album was somewhat a departure from the band's two previous albums. One reason for this was a switch of producers from Gordon Raphael to David Kahne. Despite its initial strong sales, First Impressions of Earth received the worst reception, both commercially and critically, of all their three albums. In 2006, the band played 18 sold-out shows during their UK tour. In February 2006, The Strokes won \"Best International Band\" at the NME Awards. In March, the band returned to the US with their longest tour yet. The second single off First Impressions of Earth, \"Heart in a Cage\", was released in March 2006. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/First+Impressions+of+Earth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Meanwhile, it reached #4 in the US with an entry sales week of 89,000 units, 1,000 more than that of its predecessor, First Impressions of Earth.\n\nInspired, in part, by bands like Arctic Monkeys, and Crystal Castles, The Strokes decided to experiment with various production techniques including MIDI electronic samples and Farfisa keyboards. They also overdubbed more guitars, and Casablancas toyed with vocal layers. Bassist Nikolai Fraiture revealed that the album would be \"a return to the basics\", suggesting the songs would be of similar style to their acclaimed 2001 debut record, Is This It. \"Sonically, I feel it's the album which should have been made between Room on Fire and First Impressions of Earth,\" he stated. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/Angles\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It comes nearly seven years after March 2013’s Comedown Machine, although the band had reunited briefly to release a three-track EP titled \"Future Present Past\" in June 2016.\n\nThe album title \"The New Abnormal\" is a reference to the present age of environmental disaster. “There were these huge fires in Los Angeles,” Julian  about their time recording. “A lot of houses burned down but Shangri-La  survived, by some miracle. That’s where the name of the album comes from, the extreme weather, the violence…”\n\nRumors of the album’s production began in July 2017, when Albert Hammond—father of The Strokes’ guitarist, Albert Hammond Jr.—mentioned that the band was in-studio with producer Rick Rubin in an interview with The West Australian. This rumor was quickly dispelled by Hammond Jr. in a since-deleted tweet, claiming: “Forgive Albert Sr he got prematurely excited. A lot of unknowns and nothing worth speaking about at this time.” He did concede, however, that “We met and played a few music ideas for Rick to feel out a vibe, but even a theoretical album plan would be years away, if at all.” Damage control continued with Julian joking on Twitter, saying:\n\n\"(What Albert Sr meant to say is we are working with NBA point guard Ricky Rubio on a new offense for our basketball league)\"\n\nBack in December 2018, the band announced a series of tour dates and a “global comeback” for 2019. The first event took place at The Wiltern in Los Angeles on May 13, where they performed a new song, titled “The Adults Are Talking.” The last concert of 2019 took place on New Year’s Eve at the Barclays Center in their hometown of Brooklyn, New York. They performed a new song titled “Ode to the Mets.” Julian Casablancas then confirmed:\n\n\"Yeah, we’ve got a new album coming out soon. 2020, here we come. The 2010s, whatever the fuck they’re called, we took ‘em off. And now we’ve been unfrozen and we’re back. If you really love someone, you’ll be frozen with them. You know what? I don’t know what I say generally, and I ramble a lot, but I lo\"ve you guys, and it’s a real honor to share the stage and this night with you guys.\n\n- via Rolling Stone (January 2020)\n\nNews around the album’s actual release began on February 7, 2020, when Albert Hammond Jr. tweeted: “You think you’ve been waiting. But the wait has just begun. Welcome to the new abnormal.” Similar videos and promotions began appearing on the band members’ social media pages and billboards around the world. Leaked ASCAP listings for “songs written by Julian Casablancas” also revealed the tracklist and various co-writers on the album, including pop-rock icon Billy Idol.\n\nA few days later on February 10, 2020, the band played a live political rally in support of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders. A short musical snippet of “At the Door” played before the concert, foretelling of the song’s official release the next day, along with the music video and the upcoming album’s tracklist and album art. The band also performed a new song titled “Bad Decisions,” which was released the following Tuesday, February 18, 2020, along with its accompanying music video. According to Albert Hammond Jr.’s Twitter, this would be the first official single for the new record.\n\nOn April 6, 2020, the band released “Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus” as the final single preceding the album’s release.\n\nThe New Abnormal debuted at #8 on the Billboard 200 during the chart week of April 26, 2020 after selling approximately 35,000 album-equivalent units during its first week.\n\nOn March 14, 2021, The Strokes won their first-ever Grammy Award for Best Rock Album of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Strokes/The+New+Abnormal\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The disc, titled Acoustic Hits, is the eighteen songs from the North American release re-recorded using acoustic guitars.\n\nHistory:\nThe subsequently released Greatest Hits features select singles from their then-25 year history, along with the two new tracks “Cut Here” and “Just Say Yes.” All songs were newly remastered specifically for the collection.\n\nIn an effort to provide something new for the hardcore fans who owned the previously released songs, Robert arranged for the band and former member Boris Williams to re-record acoustic versions of the Greatest Hits. Only the select first pressings of Greatest Hits were bundled with the bonus disc of Acoustic Hits.\n\nGreatest Hits was also released on VHS and DVD. The video track listing mirrors that of the North American audio CD, with the exception of “The Caterpillar,” “Pictures of You” and “Close to Me (Closest Mix)” which appear as hidden Easter eggs. Six of the acoustic performances also appear on the DVD.\n\nThe first vinyl version of this album was released on Record Store Day 2017 (22 April 2017) as two LP picture discs by the label Elektra Catalog Group. A quantity of 3250 was pressed. The release does not include the content of the Acoustic Hits disc. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/The+Cure/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

However, Thriller's lyrics deal with generally darker themes, including paranoia and the supernatural.\n\nWith a production budget of $750,000, recording sessions took place between April and November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Assisted by producer Quincy Jones, Jackson wrote four of Thriller's nine tracks. Following the release of the album's first single \"The Girl Is Mine\", some observers assumed Thriller would only be a minor hit record. With the release of the second single \"Billie Jean\", the album topped the charts in many countries. It reached number one in the United States and the United Kingdom simultaneously, becoming the first album to do so. At its peak, the album was selling a million copies a week worldwide. In just over a year, Thriller became the best-selling album of all time. Sales are estimated to be over 110 million copies sold worldwide as of March 2010. Seven of the album's nine songs were released as singles, and all reached the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album won a record-breaking seven Grammy Awards at the 1984 Grammys. Despite numerous five-star reviews, Thriller was not universally praised.\n\nThriller cemented Jackson as one of the predominant pop stars of the late 20th century, and enabled him to break down racial barriers via his appearances on MTV and meetings with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools—the videos for Thriller, \"Billie Jean\" and \"Beat It\" all received regular rotation on MTV. In 2001, a special edition issue of the album was released, which contains additional audio interviews, a demo recording and the song \"Someone In the Dark\", which was a Grammy-winning track from the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook. In 2008, the album was reissued again as Thriller 25, containing re-mixes that feature contemporary artists, a previously unreleased song and a DVD.\n\nThriller ranked number 20 on Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003, and was listed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers at number three in their Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. Thriller was preserved by the Library of Congress to the National Recording Registry, as it was deemed \"culturally significant\".\n\nProducer: Quincy Jones\nCo-producer, lead and backup vocals: Michael Jackson\nGuitar: David Williams, Dean Parks, Steve Lukather, Paul Jackson\nBass: Louis Johnson, Steve Lukather\nSaxophone and flute: Larry Williams\nTrumpet and flügelhorn: Jerry Hey, Gary Grant\nTrombone: Bill Reichenbach\nDrums: Jeff Porcaro and N'dugu Chancler\nPercussion: Paulinho Da Costa\nKeyboards/synthesizers/programming: Greg Phillinganes, Steve Porcaro, David Paich, Brian Banks\nKeyboards/synthesizers: Michael Boddicker, David Foster, Bill Wolfer, Rod Temperton\nSynthesizer programming: Anthony Marinelli\nHorn and string arrangements: Jerry Hey\nBackup vocals: James Ingram, Bunny Hull and Becky Lopez\nRecording engineer/mixer: Bruce Swedien\nTechnical engineer: Matt Forger\n\nReleased November 30, 1982\nRecorded April 4 November 8, 1982, Westlake Studios, Los Angeles, California\nGenre Pop, R&B, Funk, Soul\nLength 42:19\nLabel Epic EK-38112 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the United Kingdom, the BBFC gave it a '15' certificate because it included the video for \"Thriller\". It is the first Jackson album with an age certificate. Along with the original material, the reissue contained remixes, new material, a DVD and collaborations with several contemporary artists.\n\nTwo singles, \"The Girl Is Mine 2008\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008\", were released from the album to moderate success and a number of the other remixes charted, despite no physical release. Thriller 25 was a commercial success, selling three million copies worldwide in its 12 weeks, and was generally well received among critics, despite their view that the new material was not as inspiring as the original. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Thriller+25+Super+Deluxe+Edition\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Jackson collaborated with a number of other writers and performers such as Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Rod Temperton. Five singles were released from the album. Three of the singles had music videos released. Jackson wrote several of the songs himself, including the Platinum-certified lead single, \"Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough\". It was his first solo release under Epic Records, the label he would record on until his death in 2009.\n\nThe record was a departure from Jackson's previous work for Motown. Several critics observed that \"Off the Wall\" was crafted from funk, disco-pop, soft rock, jazz and pop ballads. Jackson received positive reviews for his vocal performance on the record. The record gained positive reviews and won the singer his first Grammy Award since the early 1970s. With \"Off the Wall\", Jackson became the first solo artist to have four singles from the same album peak inside the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. The album was a commercial success; to date it is certified for 8× Multi-Platinum in the US and has sold more than 20 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best selling albums of all time.\n\nOn October 16, 2001, a special edition reissue of Off the Wall was released by Sony Records. Recent reviews by Allmusic and Blender have continued to praise Off the Wall for its appeal in the 21st century. In 2003, the album was ranked number 68 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The National Association of Recording Merchandisers listed it at number 80 of the Definitive 200 Albums of All Time. In 2008, \"Off the Wall\" was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Off+the+Wall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Dangerous was the first album Michael Jackson released in the 1990s, on November 26, 1991. It became his third best-selling album and second to debut at #1 on the Billboard 200 album chart, where it spent the next 4 weeks - selling 8 million copies in the US. With sales of approximately 30 million copies worldwide, it is Jackson's best-selling recording of the nineties and near ties with Bad as his second-best selling album, behind Thriller.\n\nAccording to the sleeve notes on the later remastered edition of the album, recording sessions began in Los Angeles, California at Ocean Way/Record One  Studio 2 on June 25, 1990. The sessions ended at Larrabee North and Ocean Way Studio on October 29, 1991, being the most extensive recording project of Jackson's career at the time (over 16 months compared to the usual 6 spent for his previous three studio albums).\n\nIn March 1991, Jackson signed a 15 year, 6 album deal to Sony Music. The press reported that Sony actually handed over $1 billion to Jackson, but that was not the case. At the time, Sony estimated that if the albums Jackson released under the new contract sold at the same level they currently sold, it would generate over $1 billion in profits for them. Additionally, Jackson was awarded the highest royalty rate in the business. By the time the contract expired in March 2006, Michael would have been paid $45 million from Sony ($1 million a year, plus $5 million per album delivered). This does not include money he would have also earned from sales of albums, singles, videos etc. Under this contract, Jackson is estimated to have earned $175 million from album sales alone.\n\nAt this point, Dangerous was already in the making, under the producing talents of (Quincy Jones recommended) 23-year-old Teddy Riley and Grammy-winner Bill Bottrell. The previous album, Bad, was Jackson's last designed for the LP industry, conforming to the usual 10-song within 50-minute format, whereas Dangerous was a 77-minute, 14-track compilation, which almost dared the capacity of early Nineties compact discs. Consequently, the record was released as a double album in vinyl.\n\nDangerous was a highly anticipated album, as shown by an incident at the Los Angeles International Airport, where a group of armed robbers stole 30,000 copies before its official release. Because of this, more early copies of the album were released in several countries on November 21 followed by the official November 26 release date.\n\nThe album is also well known for the cover's mysterious nature.It's also known for the number of occult symbols.(eg: the world upside down in the middle) A special limited-edition of the album was initially released in a large box with a picture of Jackson's eyes, which folded open to reveal the normal cover (painted by pop surrealist Mark Ryden), in pop-up card, with the CD and booklet in the bottom.\n\nDangerous was released on November 26, 1991 with record-breaking sales. Dangerous  was Jackson's fastest-selling album ever in the United States with seven million shipped in under two months. This broke the sales record for Bad, which had also shipped seven million copies in 1987, but in twice as many months.\n\nDangerous debuted at #1 on the Billboard Hot 200 Album Charts, with 326,500 copies sold in its first week. It held the position for four weeks until being replaced by Nirvana's Nevermind; the switch has been cited as an important signal helping to break alternative rock into the mainstream. Jackson helped promote the album with a high-profile performance at the Super Bowl and an interview with Oprah Winfrey, but it did not return to the #1 slot. However, it returned to the Top Ten after Jackson received the Grammy Legend Award at the 1993 ceremony. Dangerous spent 117 weeks inside the Billboard 200, thirty weeks more than Bad. The RIAA certified Dangerous 8x platinum, for shipping 8 million copies.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the album debuted at #1, holding off U2's Achtung Baby, but in the second week it was replaced by Queen's Greatest Hits II. Dangerous spent 23 weeks in the Top 10, and a total of 96 weeks on the Top 75 chart.\n\n\"Black or White\" was produced and co-written by Bill Bottrell. The single was Jackson's biggest hit since 1983's \"Billie Jean\". In all, nine singles were released, spanning two years (1991-1993). A planned single release of the title track \"Dangerous\" was canceled in late 1993 due to the child molestation allegations. Seven singles reached the UK Top 10, the most for any Jackson album.\n\n48% of Bad's worldwide sales were in the UK and US; for Dangerous, the total was 33%, reflecting Jackson's growing global reach. For the most part, the singles from Dangerous were bigger hits in Europe and Australia than in the United States. Dangerous sold very well in both Asia and South America, two emerging and growing record markets, and was supported by the Dangerous World Tour. Prior to the release of Jackson's next studio album, HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I, Dangerous had already sold over twenty-two million copies worldwide.bIn the space of 17 years, sources estimate the record has sold between 30 and 32 million copies worldwide making it a faster selling album than his previous record Bad.\n\nThe album was included at number 115 on the list of the \"Definitive 200\" albums of all time developed by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers.\n\nAs was becoming the standard for Jackson, the album's music videos were among the most costly and innovative of their time. Several of the music videos taken from the Dangerous  album had complex storylines and dance sequences, and featured cameo appearances by celebrities. The video for \"Jam\", directed by David Kellogg, showed Jackson and Michael Jordan playing basketball and dancing together, while \"Remember the Time\", directed by John Singleton, was set in an Ancient Egyptian palace, and starred Eddie Murphy, Magic Johnson and Iman. \"In the Closet\" featured Jackson and supermodel Naomi Campbell as lovers. The director of the video was photographer Herb Ritts, who also photographed Jackson in a series of promotional shots for the release of the Dangerous album. The video clip for \"Who Is It\" is notable as it was directed by David Fincher who later went on direct a number of films including Se7en, Fight Club and Zodiac. For the video \"Give Into Me\", Michael appears in a concert setting, featuring Guns N Roses guitarist Slash.\n\n\"Black or White\" was originally over ten minutes long, premiering simultaneously on November 14, 1991 on MTV, VH1, BET, and Fox. The video featured one of the earliest examples of computer-generated morphing. The last four minutes of the video also induced much controversy, as it depicted Jackson smashing store windows and destroying a car with a crowbar. Jackson said this destructive behaviour was intended to imply a message of anti-racism and racist graffiti was added in later versions to make the violence more understandable. The music video was also controversial because of Jackson's sexually suggestive dance, which included the crotch grab as well as zipping up his pants. MTV and the other music video networks decided to excise the last four minutes of the \"Black or White\" video for all subsequent airings, and Jackson issued a statement apologizing to anyone who had been offended, and explaining that he tried to interpret the animal instinct of panthers into a dance. The video featured Macaulay Culkin and an appearance during the morphing scene by young Tyra Banks and was directed by John Landis, also the director of the \"Thriller\" short film.\n\nAlternative editions of the albums became very rare, products almost exclusive for record collectors. The most notable editions were a 1992 edition that folded out to become a diorama, a 1993 Japan remix compilation and a 1993 Australia two-disc edition that contained bonus remixes.\n\nAn international re-release of the album (entitled Dangerous: Special Edition) took place on October 16, 2001, just two weeks before the release of Jackson's studio album Invincible. Simultaneously, Special Editions of Off the Wall, Thriller and Bad were also released. For the occasion, Dangerous was digitally remastered and included a slipcase and a brand new 24-page colorful booklet with revised artwork and previously-unseen photos. The new edition managed to reach #108 in the UK charts (the only one of those four re-releases that didn't enter the Top 75 there). Because of the constraints of Dangerous' running time, previously unreleased songs were not included. Originally, Dangerous: Special Edition was to be released as a double disc release, the 1st disc featuring the original 14 track album, the 2nd filled with unreleased tracks. This project was scrapped at the last moment, however many of the tracks were eventually leaked onto the internet along with various demos of other tracks that appeared on the album. In 2004, some of these leaked tracks were officially released on The Ultimate Collection (namely the \"Dangerous\" (Early Version) and \"Monkey Business\"). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Michael+Jackson/Dangerous\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The name was inspired by a phrase the band adopted to keep themselves motivated while on their tour.\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long has 12 songs, plus 6 bonus tracks. The band stated in interviews that the album has a different feel to it from their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane. The songs are not all based on one specific relationship, as in Jane, and also have a different sound than their first album, being more electric and drawing inspiration from such artists as Talking Heads, Michael Jackson and Prince. A review written prior to the album's release described the songs as having a very retro feel. Adam Levine explained that this record is a little more self-confident and powerful lyrically: \"...you can dance to it, there's a little more attitude.\"\n\nAccording to Levine, working with other artists had influences on the album: \"Kanye West and Alicia Keys are amazing talents, in totally different ways. Just seeing such amazing people working in the studio. I definitely took things away from them.\"\n\nThe chorus of \"Nothing Lasts Forever\" is the same as the one used in the Kanye West single \"Heard 'Em Say\", which features Adam Levine, with exclusion to the line: \"...the distance between us makes it so hard to stay...\"\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, selling 429,000 copies in its first week of release. It Won't Be Soon Before Long sold 102,000 copies digitally, breaking a record set last week when Linkin Park's Minutes to Midnight (Machine Shop/Warner Bros.) moved 84,000 via that format to debut at No. 1. The latter album slips to No. 2 this week with 198,000, a 68% sales decline. In December 2007, the album ranked number one for iTunes top best selling albums of 2007.\n\nIn the UK, it became their second album to reach the number one spot, but their first to debut atop the UK Albums Chart. In Australia, peaked at number five, lower than their first studio album Songs About Jane which peaked at number one in 2004. It peaked at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart and New Zealand. At number three in Ireland, Japan and Mexico, at number five in Australia and Taiwan, and number six in Italy, Spain and Switzerland.\n\nIt Won't Be Soon Before Long was certified Gold in Ireland, Italy and New Zealand, platinum in Australia, Canada, Japan and the UK. 2x Platinum in the US, and 3x Platinum in South Korea.

It was released on 24 January 2011 in Europe and on 22 February 2011 in North America by XL Recordings and Columbia Records. The album was named after the age of the singer during its production. 21 shares the folk and Motown soul influences of her 2008 debut album 19, but was further inspired by the American country and Southern blues music to which she had been exposed during her 2008–09 North American tour An Evening with Adele. Composed in the aftermath of the singer's separation from her then partner, the album typifies the near dormant tradition of the confessional singer-songwriter in its exploration of heartbreak, self-examination, and forgiveness.\n\nAdele began writing 21 in April 2009, when still involved in the relationship that subsequently inspired the record. Dissatisfied with once again portraying herself as the musical tragedian of her debut, she had intended to compose a more upbeat and contemporary follow-up. However, studio sessions ended prematurely due to a lack of inspiration. She resumed production immediately after the breakdown of her relationship, channelling her heartbreak and depression into her songs. Adele collaborated with various songwriters and producers, including Columbia Records co-president Rick Rubin, Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Jim Abbiss, and Dan Wilson.\n\nPraised by critics for its understated production, vintage aesthetic, and Adele's vocal performance, 21 defied the modest commercial expectations of her independent record label XL Recordings. The album topped the charts in more than 30 countries and became the world's best-selling album of the year for 2011 and 2012. In the United Kingdom, it is the best-selling album of the 21st century and fourth best-selling album of all time, while its 23-week tenure atop the UK Albums Chart is the longest by a female solo artist. In the United States, the album held the top position for 24 weeks, longer than any other album since 1985 and the longest by a female solo artist in Billboard 200 history. In addition, it had the most weeks on the Billboard 200 chart of any album by a woman. It was certified Diamond by the RIAA and was ranked as the \"Greatest Billboard 200 Album of All Time.\"\n\nFive singles were released to promote the album, with Rolling in the Deep, Someone like You and Set Fire to the Rain becoming international number-one songs, while Rumour Has It charted in the top 20 across Europe and North America. Globally, 21 was the biggest selling musical release for both 2011 and 2012, and helped revitalise lagging sales of the UK and US music industry. With over 30 million copies sold worldwide, 21 is one of the best-selling albums of all time and one of the best-selling albums of the 21st century. Critics hailed the album as a shift from the overtly sexual and musically bombastic status quo, and attributed its success to its deeply autobiographical yet universal songs. Shortlisted for the 2011 Mercury Prize, 21 won the 2012 Grammy Award for Album of the Year and the Brit Award for British Album of the Year. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/21\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Its lyrical content features themes of Adele \"yearning for her old self, her nostalgia\", and \"melancholia about the passage of time\" according to an interview with the singer by Rolling Stone, as well as themes of motherhood and regret. In contrast to Adele's previous works, the production of 25 incorporated the use of electronic elements and creative rhythmic patterns, with elements of 1980s R&B and organs.\n\n25 received generally positive reviews from music critics, who commended its production and Adele's vocal performance. Issued nearly five years after the release of her second album, the internationally successful 21, the album was widely anticipated and Adele's record labels promoted the album with an extensive marketing campaign. 25 became a massive commercial success, debuting at number one in 32 countries and breaking first-week sales records in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom and United States. In the US, the album sold over 3.38 million copies in its first week of sales, marking the largest single-week sales for an album since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking point-of-sale music purchases in 1991. 25 was the world's best-selling album of the year for 2015, with 17.4 million copies sold within the year, and has gone on to sell over 22 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth-best selling album of the 21st century, the second-best selling album of the 2010s (behind 21), and one of the best-selling albums of all-time. Following 21, it was certified Diamond by the RIAA, making Adele the only artist of the 2010s to achieve this certification with two albums. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adele/25\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Spears began working on this album as early as February 2006, exploring into electropop, synthpop  and techno. The album has also a more R&B/urban sound and recording with new producers such as Danja. Blackout was her first studio album in four years since 2003's In the Zone  and is the first time Spears is the executive producer of one of her albums. The album's title refers to \"blacking out negativity and embracing life fully\".  The songs on the album are thematically focused on sex, love and Spears' relationship–struggle with the media.\n\nBlackout debuted at number two on the Billboard 200, becoming her first and so far only studio album not to debut at number one due to a last-minute rules change by the Billboard music association. According to the IFPI, the album was 32nd in terms of units shipped by the end of 2007.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Gimme More\", peaked at number one in the Canadian Hot 100 and became a top five hit in twelve countries. The second single, \"Piece of Me\", reached number one in Ireland. The final single, \"Break the Ice\", reached number one in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play, making all the singles of the album go to the top position of at least a chart. All three songs frequently appeared on the lists that included the best records of the year. Even though initial critical response was mixed to positive, the album later won high critical acclaim and appeared on many lists that included the decade's best albums. The album was named the 5th \"Best Pop Album of the Decade\" by The Times, the 7th-best album of the decade on the Rolling Stones \"The Decade-End Readers’ Poll\", and the 3rd Best Album of the decade on the Billboard \"Readers Poll\", and won \"Album of the Year\" at the MTV Europe Music Awards 2008. To date, the album has sold over 3.2 million copies worldwide, and was named #441 on Rolling Stone Magazine's updated list of the Top 500 Albums of All Time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Britney+Spears/Blackout\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The sound consists of 80s, 90s & 00s inspired synth-pop, dance-pop & power-pop.\n\nWhen teasing and promoting the record since May 2021, Charli took on an evil, demonic or soulless persona, so as to play into a deal-with-the-devil idea. Visuals for the album include \"femme fatale powers\" and a multitude of \"dark spells and curses\" as well as signature nods to both cars and car crashes. Its title and overall aesthetic was inspired by David Cronenberg's 1996 movie 'Crash'.\n\nOn May 23, 2021, she indicated that the album was \"for the \"True Romance\" angels\" and that she wanted to have a song that is \"Stay Away 2.0\". Then, on July 8, Charli posted that she was extremely into songs that she did not compose. During this month, Charli began to publish a lot of tweets and Instagram photographs indicating that the album would be her \"evil era\". One of them reads, \"Tip for young artists: sell your soul for money and fame\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/CRASH\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Another track called \"I Got It\" featuring Brooke Candy, Cupcakke and Pabllo Vittar was released on 13 December 2017 as the final promotional single before the mixtape's official release.\n\nAt review aggregate site Metacritic, Pop 2 has an average score of 84 out of 100, based on 8 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Meaghan Garvey of Pitchfork, who gave the album an 8.4/10, called it \"the best full-length work of both Charli and PC Music’s respective careers,\" opining that \"though Pop 2 sounds like the future, even more delightful is the way it hybridizes sounds from the past two decades of weirdo electronics.\" Ludovic Hunter-Tilney of Financial Times wrote that Charli XCX \"stands out as a paragon of progressiveness,\" opining that \"on the majority of the tracks Charli and her producer Cook deploy their meta-pop tactics with a skilful sense of dramatic engagement.\"\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/Pop+2\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Gormely concluded that \"there's enough that works on Vroom Vroom to hope that it's the beginning of something much bigger\". Drowned in Sound's Lee Adcock compared the EP positively to Charli's previous album Sucker, but criticized its usage of \"pre-established styles of other black artists\" to create \"PG-rated, glittery sketches of excess bling and forbidden love\". In a negative review for Pitchfork, Laura Snapes wrote that \"no one is being done any favors reducing Charli XCX to a vapid cypher, particularly as it drains her vivid personality from the work\". However, in November 2019, Snapes expressed regret about her review, tweeting that she would like to \"publicly disavow the nonsense\" she wrote about the EP. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charli+XCX/Vroom+Vroom+EP\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "American Idiot is the seventh studio album by the American punk rock band Green Day. It was co-produced with longterm collaborator Rob Cavallo and released on September 21, 2004 through Reprise Records.\n\nIn mid-2003, the band began recording songs for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines. However, the master tracks were lost and the band decided to start over rather than re-record Cigarettes and Valentines. They decided to produce a rock opera, inspired by the work of The Who and numerous musicals. It follows the life of \"Jesus of Suburbia\", a sort of anti-hero created by Billie Joe Armstrong. Following early recording at Oakland, California's Studio 880, the band finished the album in Los Angeles.\n\nThe album achieved popularity worldwide, charting in 26 countries and reaching number one in nineteen of them, including the United States and the United Kingdom. Since its release, American Idiot has sold over 16 million copies worldwide, including 267,000 in its opening week. The album won numerous awards including a Grammy for Best Rock Album, and was generally well received by critics.\n\nIn mid-2003, Green Day convened at Studio 880 in Oakland, California, and recorded about 20 songs for an album titled Cigarettes and Valentines. However, the master tracks went missing. The band, wondering if it should re-record the songs, consulted with producer Rob Cavallo over what to do. Cavallo told the band members to ask themselves if the missing tracks represented their best work. Guitarist Billie Joe Armstrong said the band members \"couldn't honestly look at ourselves and say, 'That was the best thing we've ever done.' So we decided to move on and do something completely new.\" The band members agreed to spend the next three months writing new material.\n\nThe first new song Green Day wrote was \"American Idiot\". The band had difficulty following it up. One day, bassist Mike Dirnt was in the studio recording a 30-second song by himself. Armstrong decided he wanted to do the same, and drummer Tré Cool followed suit. Armstrong recalled, \"It started getting more serious as we tried to outdo one another. We kept connecting these little half-minute bits until we had something.\" This musical suite became \"Homecoming\", and the band subsequently wrote another suite, \"Jesus of Suburbia\". Armstrong was so emboldened by the creation of the two suites that he decided to make the record an album-long conceptual piece. The band took inspiration from concept records by The Who, as well as musicals including West Side Story and Jesus Christ Superstar. During their sessions at Studio 880, the members of Green Day spent their days writing material and would stay up late, drinking and discussing music. The band set up a pirate radio station from which it would broadcast jam sessions, along with occasional crank calls.\n\nWith demos completed, Green Day relocated to Los Angeles to continue work on the album. The group first recorded at Ocean Way Recording, then moved to Capitol Studios to complete the album. Armstrong said, \"As a songwriter, I get so deep into what I'm writing about, it's almost like I have to stir up shit to write about it.\" The band admitted to partying during the L.A. sessions; Armstrong had to schedule vocal recording sessions around his hangovers. Armstrong described the environment, \"For the first time, we separated from our pasts, from how we were supposed to behave as Green Day. For the first time, we fully accepted the fact that we're rock stars.\"\n\nAmerican Idiot is a concept album that tells the story of a central character named Jesus of Suburbia. The album was a departure from Green Day's typical way of writing music. Armstrong said, \"As soon as you abandon the verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge  structure ... it opens up your mind to this different way of writing, where there really are no rules.\" Armstrong said the band aimed to be ambitious, which he felt many contemporary rock bands were not.\n\nThe band favored loud guitar sounds for the record; Armstrong said \"we were like, 'Let's just go balls-out on the guitar sound--plug in the Les Pauls and Marshalls and let it rip'\". The guitarist played more lead guitar on the album than he had on any previous release, which he said he previously shied away from for fear of sounding \"corny\". Armstrong added tracks of acoustic guitar-playing throughout the record to augment his electric guitar rhythms and Cool's drumming, creating a percussive sound.\n\nThe album's protagonist, Jesus of Suburbia, emerged out of Armstrong asking himself what sort of person the title of \"American Idiot\" referred to. Armstrong described the character as essentially an anti-hero, a powerless \"everyman\" desensitized by a \"steady diet of soda pop and Ritalin\". Jesus of Suburbia hates his town and those close to him, so he leaves for the city. As the album progresses the characters St. Jimmy and Whatsername are introduced. St. Jimmy is a punk rock freedom fighter. Whatsername, inspired by the Bikini Kill song \"Rebel Girl\", is a \"Mother Revolution\" figure that Armstrong described as \"kind of St. Jimmy's nemesis in a lot of ways\". Both characters illustrate the \"rage vs. love\" theme of the album, in that \"you can go with the blind rebellion of self-destruction, where Saint Jimmy is. But there's a more love-driven side to that, which is following your beliefs and ethics. And that's where Jesus of Suburbia really wants to go\", according to Armstrong. Near the end of the story, St. Jimmy apparently commits suicide. While the singer did not want to give away the details of the story's resolution, he said the intention is for the listener to ultimately realize that Jesus of Suburbia is really St. Jimmy, and Jimmy is \"part of the main character that pretty much dies\". In the album final song, \"Whatsername\", Jesus of Suburbia loses his connection with Whatsername as well.\n\nUpon American Idiot's release in September 2004, American Idiot peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. It achieved five times platinum status in the United States, eight times platinum status in Canada and six times platinum status in the United Kingdom. Five singles were released in support of the album, all of which charted on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" topped both the Mainstream and the Modern Rock charts. Its music video received heavy airplay on music television.\n\nAllmusic praised the album from both perspectives; either as \"a collection of great songs\", or as a whole. Pitchfork Media said the \"ambitious\" album was successful in getting across its message, and \"keeps its mood and method deliberately, tenaciously, and angrily on point\". Uncut wrote that although the album was heavily politically focused, \"slam-dancing is still possible\", in a moderate review, while The New York Times praised Green Day for trumping \"any pretension with melody and sheer fervor\".\n\nEntertainment Weekly said that despite being based on a musical theater concept \"that periodically makes no sense\", Green Day \"make the journey entertaining enough\". It described most of the songs as forgettable, though, arguing the album focuses more on lyrics than music. Robert Christgau's C+ said the album featured \"emotional travails of two clueless punks\" using \"devices that sunk under their own weight back when The Who invented them\", and The Guardian called American Idiot a mess—\"but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess\". Rolling Stone said the album could have been, and was, a mess, but that the \"individual tunes are tough and punchy enough to work on their own\".\n\nIn 2005, American Idiot won a Grammy for Best Rock Album and was nominated in four other categories including Album of the Year. The album helped Green Day win seven of the eight awards they were nominated for at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards; the \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" video won six of those awards. A year later, \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\" won a Grammy for Record of the Year. It was named The number 1 album of the Century by Kerrang in 2009.\n\nA musical adaption of the album was created and released in 2009, American Idiot premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre on September 4 2009. It was initially intended to run through October 11, but before the premiere, the theatre announced a three week extension. The new closing date is November 1. The musical is a collaboration between Green Day and Michael Mayer (Tony Award winning director of Spring Awakening). Green Day does not appear in the production, but the show has got an onstage band. The cast features Tony award winner John Gallagher Jr. (Spring Awakening) as Johnny, Michael Esper (A Man for All Seasons) as Will, Tony Vincent (Jesus Christ Superstar) as St Jimmy, Rebecca Naomi Jones as Whatsername, Mary Faber as Heather, along with 14 other actors.  The show features all of the songs from the album American Idiot, some b-side tracks and a few songs from Green Day's later album, 21st Century Breakdown. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/American+Idiot\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was the band's first collaboration with producer Rob Cavallo. Released on February 1, 1994 through Reprise Records, \"Dookie\" became a worldwide commercial success, reaching number two on the U.S. Billboard 200 and charting in seven countries. The album helped to propel Green Day into mainstream popularity, amid claims from the punk rock community that the band had \"sold out\".\n\n\"Dookie\" produced five singles for the band: \"Longview\", the re-recorded \"Welcome to Paradise\", \"Basket Case\", the radio-only single \"She\" and \"When I Come Around\". As of 2008, Dookie is the band's best-selling album, with over 15 million copies sold worldwide. \"Dookie\" won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1995.\n\nFollowing the underground success of the band's second album \"Kerplunk\", a number of major labels became interested in Green Day. Representatives of these labels attempted to entice the band to sign by inviting them for meals to discuss a deal, with one manager even inviting the group to Disneyland. The band declined these advances until meeting producer and Reprise representative Rob Cavallo. They were impressed by his work with fellow Californian band The Muffs, and later remarked that Cavallo \"was the only person we could really talk to and connect with\".\n\nEventually, the band left their independent record label Lookout! Records on friendly terms, and signed to Reprise. Signing to a major label caused many of the band's original fans from the independent music club 924 Gilman Street to regard Green Day as sell-outs. The club has banned Green Day from entering since the major label signing. Reflecting back on the period, lead vocalist Billie Joe Armstrong told Spin magazine in 1999, \"I couldn't go back to the punk scene, whether we were the biggest success in the world or the biggest failure  The only thing I could do was get on my bike and go forward.\"\n\nRob Cavallo was chosen as the main producer of the album, with Jerry Finn as the mixer. Green Day originally gave the first demo tape to Cavallo, and after listening to it during the car ride home he sensed that \"had stumbled on something big.\" The band's recording session lasted three weeks and the album was remixed twice. Armstrong claimed that the band wanted to create a dry sound, \"Similar to the Sex Pistols' album or first Black Sabbath albums.\" The band felt the original mix to be unsatisfactory. Cavallo agreed, and it was remixed, at Fantasy Studios in Berkeley California. Armstrong later said of their studio experience, \"Everything was already written, all we had to do was play it.\"\n\nMuch of the album's content was written by Armstrong, except \"Emenius Sleepus\" which was co-written by Armstrong and bassist Mike Dirnt, and the hidden track, \"All By Myself\", which was composed and written by drummer Tré Cool. The album touched upon various experiences of the band members and included subjects like anxiety and panic attacks, masturbation, sexual orientation, boredom, and former girlfriends.\n\nThe single \"Longview\" had a signature bass line that bass player Dirnt wrote while under the influence of LSD. He originally forgot much of it, but the remembered portions were included in the song. Armstrong stated that the song was mainly about boredom, masturbation, and smoking cannabis, as evident in some of the lyrics (\"When masturbation's lost its fun/You're fucking breaking\").\n\t\n\n\"Welcome to Paradise\", the second single from \"Dookie\", was originally on the second studio album by the band, \"Kerplunk\". The song was re-recorded, with a less grainy sound for \"Dookie\". The song never had an official music video, however, a certain live performance of the song is often associated as a music video. The video is located on Green Day's official website.\n\nThe radio-only single, \"She\", was written by Armstrong about a former girlfriend who showed him a feminist poem with an identical title. In return, Armstrong wrote the lyrics of \"She\" and showed them to her. She later moved to Ecuador, prompting Armstrong to put \"She\" on the album. The same ex-girlfriend is the topic of the songs \"Sassafras Roots\" and \"Chump\".\n\nAnother song, \"Coming Clean\", deals with Armstrong's coming to terms with his bisexuality when he was 16 and 17 years old. In his interview with The Advocate magazine, he says that although he has never had a relationship with a man, his sexuality has been \"something that comes up as a struggle in me\".\n\nThe hit single \"Basket Case\", which appeared on many singles charts worldwide, was also inspired by Armstrong's personal experiences. The song deals with Armstrong's anxiety attacks and feelings of \"going crazy\" prior to being diagnosed with a panic disorder. The music video was filmed in an abandoned mental institution.\n\nThe final single, \"When I Come Around\", was again inspired by a woman, though this time being about Armstrong's wife, then former girlfriend, Adrienne. Following a dispute between the couple, Armstrong left Adrienne to spend some time alone. The video featured the three band members walking around Berkeley and San Francisco at night, eventually ending up back at the original location. Future touring back up guitarist, Jason White, made a cameo in the video with his then-girlfriend.\n\nBillie Joe Armstrong wrote the song \"In The End\" about his mother and her boyfriend (similar to Why Do You Want Him). He is quoted saying: \"That song is about my mother's husband, it's not really about a girl, or like anyone directly related to me in a relationship. In the End's about my mother.\"\n\nThe name of the album is a reference to the band members often suffering from diarrhea, which they referred to as \"liquid dookie\", as a result of eating spoiled food whilst on tour. Initially the band were to name the album \"Liquid Dookie\", however this was deemed \"too gross\", and so they settled on the name \"Dookie\".\n\nThe cover art is an illustration by Richie Bucher, which depicts bombs being dropped on people and buildings. In the center, there is an explosion, with the band's name at the top. Armstrong has since explained the meaning of the artwork: “I wanted the art work to look really different. I wanted it to represent the East Bay and where we come from, because there's a lot of artists in the East Bay scene that are just as important as the music. So we talked to Richie Bucher. He did a 7-inch cover for this band called Raooul that I really liked. He's also been playing in bands in the East Bay for years. There's pieces of us buried on the album cover. There's one guy with his camera up in the air taking a picture with a beard. He took pictures of bands every weekend at Gilman's. The robed character that looks like Ozzy Osbourne is the woman on the cover of the first Ozzy album. Angus Young is in there somewhere too. The graffiti reading \"Twisted Dog Sisters\" refers to these two girls from Berkeley. I think the guy saying \"The fritter, fat boy\" was a reference to a local cop.”\n\nThe back cover on early prints of the CD featured a plush toy of Ernie from Sesame Street, which was airbrushed out of later prints for fear of litigation. Some rumors suggest that it was removed because it led parents to think that \"Dookie\" was a child's lullaby album or that the creators of Sesame Street had sued Green Day.\n\nUpon its release, \"Dookie\" charted in seven countries. The album peaked at number two on Billboard 200 in the United States, and was a success in several other countries, peaking as high as number one in New Zealand; the lowest peak in any country was in the United Kingdom at number 13. While all the singles from the album charted in a few countries, the hit single \"Basket Case\" entered the top 10 in the United Kingdom and Sweden. Later in 1995, the album received a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album, with \"Longview\" and \"Basket Case\" both being nominated for a Grammy.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, \"Dookie\" continued to sell well, eventually receiving diamond certification in 1999; To date, \"Dookie\" has sold over 15 million copies worldwide and remains the band's best-selling album.\n\nOn April 18, 2009 Dookie was reissued on 180 gram vinyl for the 2nd annual 'Record Store Day'.\n\nThe album was well received by some critics, with Allmusic describing \"Dookie\" as \"a stellar piece of modern punk that many tried to emulate but nobody bettered\". In 1994, Time claimed \"Dookie\" as the third best album of the year, but the best rock album of 1994. The New York Times, in early 1995, described the sound of \"Dookie\" as, \"Punk turns into pop in fast, funny, catchy, high-powered songs about whining and channel-surfing; apathy has rarely sounded so passionate.\"\n\nHowever, many other music critics, and even some other mainstream bands, claimed the band had sold out for signing to a major label, and called them \"watered down punk imposters\". The New York Times, while complementary on the album's overall quality, noted that the pop sound of \"Dookie\" only remotely resembled punk music. The band did not respond initially to these comments, but later claimed that they were \"just trying to be themselves\" and that \"it's our band, we can do whatever we want\". Dirnt claimed that the follow-up album \"Insomniac\", one of the band's hardest albums lyrically and musically, was the band releasing their anger at all the criticism from critics and former fans.\n\nSince its release, \"Dookie\" has featured heavily in various \"must have\" lists compiled by the music media. Some of the more prominent of these lists to feature \"Dookie\" are shown below; this information is adapted from Acclaimed Music.\n\nKerrang! \tUnited Kingdom \tThe Kerrang! 100 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die 1998 \t33\nClassic Rock & Metal Hammer \tUnited Kingdom \tThe 200 Greatest Albums of the 90s \t2006 \t*\nRobert Dimery \tUnited States \t1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die \t2005 \t*\nRolling Stone \tUnited States \tRolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time \t2003 \t193\nSpin Magazine \tUnited States \t100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005 \t2005 \t44\nRock and Roll Hall of Fame \tUnited States \tThe Definitive 200 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Dookie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band had been working on new material since January 2006. By October 2007, Armstrong had 45 songs written, but the band showed no further signs of progress until October 2008, when a video of the group recording with producer Butch Vig in the studio was posted on YouTube. The writing and recording process, spanning three years and four recording studios, was finally finished in April 2009.\n\nThe album received generally positive reception. 21st Century Breakdown achieved Green Day's best chart performance to date. Upon its release, 21st Century Breakdown reached number one on the charts of at least fourteen countries. The album subsequently achieved number one on the Billboard 200, European Top 100 Albums and UK Albums Charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/21st+Century+Breakdown\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album is the band's third-best selling album behind Dookie and American Idiot with over 7 million copies sold worldwide.\nn 1995, a new single for the Angus soundtrack was released, titled \"J.A.R.\". The single went straight to number one on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song was followed by Insomniac, which was released in the fall of 1995. Insomniac opened to a warm critical reception, earning four out of five stars from Rolling Stone, which said \"In punk, the good stuff actually unfolds and gains meaning as you listen without sacrificing any of its electric, haywire immediacy. And Green Day are as good as this stuff gets.\"\n\nBefore the name 'Insomniac', the band considered the naming the album Tight Wad Hill (After the thirteenth track of the album) After visiting collage artist Winston Smith for the album cover, Billie Joe Armstrong asked him how he managed to make such intricate pieces in such short times. Smith answered, \"It's easy for me. I am an insomniac.\"\nThe collage on the album cover was created by Winston Smith  and is called God Told Me to Skin You Alive, a reference to the Dead Kennedys song \"I Kill Children\". Interestingly enough, the cover art contains an image (the dentist) that was originally used in a collage featured in the inside cover art of Dead Kennedys' album Plastic Surgery Disasters. Smith knew Tré Cool from Green Day's time at Lookout! Records and told Tré that if he ever needed album artwork that he should call him. The cover art features several hidden images: a naked woman, 3 fairies, and several other ghostly faces in the flames. There are also three skulls on the entire album cover and back; one for each member of Green Day. One of the skulls requires you to view the piece at an angle. The hidden skull is taken from Hans Holbein's 1533 painting 'The Ambassadors'. Green Day's version, however, is slightly different from the original, with the woman holding Billie Joe's sky blue Fernandes imitation Stratocaster rather than an acoustic guitar. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Green+Day/Insomniac\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Produced by Gil Norton, it was the official debut of the Foo Fighters as a band, as their eponymous 1995 debut album was primarily recorded by frontman Dave Grohl and producer Barrett Jones as a demo. After the project ballooned and became an international success, the group convened for pre-production on their second album in the fall of 1996, and brought in producer Norton to establish a pop sensibility for the tracks. The band strived to create a full-fledged rock record, although the music press predicted another grunge offshoot.\n\nPrimarily inspired by Grohl's divorce from photographer Jennifer Youngblood in 1996, the lyricism on The Colour and the Shape is substantially more introspective and the music more developed. The album's track listing was designed to resemble a therapy session, splitting the album between uptempo tracks and ballads, reflecting conflicting emotions. Early sessions at the Bear Creek studio in Washington were poor and led the band to discard most of the recordings. The band regrouped without drummer William Goldsmith in early 1997 to record a second time at Hollywood's Grandmaster Recordings studio, with Grohl sitting in on drums instead. Goldsmith was offended and disgruntled that most of his material was re-recorded, and left the band shortly thereafter.\n\nThe singles \"Monkey Wrench\", \"Everlong\" and \"My Hero\" peaked within the top ten of US rock radio charts, and the album charted at number three in the United Kingdom. Critics found the album a significant American rock release of the era, and it is now viewed as a seminal modern rock album. It was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1998 for Best Rock Album. The Colour and the Shape is the Foo Fighters' biggest U.S. seller, having sold over two million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. The album was remastered and reissued in 2007 with several bonus tracks for its tenth anniversary. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/The+Colour+and+the+Shape\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Stahl departed the band just prior to the album's recording due to creative differences, wanting to play harder edged songs like the previous albums featured. Since There Is Nothing Left to Lose, the Foo Fighters have held up the same line-up of Dave Grohl, Shiflett, Hawkins, and Nate Mendel.\n\nEarly pressings of the disc included a temporary tattoo, similar to the one featured on the album cover. The album was also re-released in 2001 as a two-CD edition which offers a second VCD disc of four videos and one bonus track, Fraternity. This edition has a picture of the Australian swimmer Michael Klim on the front, chosen because he has a Foo Fighters tattoo on his left shoulder, and has also admitted to be a Foo Fighters fan several times.\n\nSinger/guitarist Dave Grohl has stated before that the album was recorded at his home and that the band would have \"a BBQ every day after recording.\"\n\nThis album was the first Foo Fighters album to have a song reach the top of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with Learn to Fly. It started a pattern of every Foo Fighters album having more weeks at the top of the chart than the one before it (There Is Nothing Left to Lose - 1 week; One By One - 10 weeks; In Your Honor - 13 weeks; Echoes, Silence, Patience and Grace - 25 weeks).\n\nThe album is widely available as an \"Enhanced CD\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Foo+Fighters/There+Is+Nothing+Left+to+Lose\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following the collaboration album Reanimation which featured remixes of their debut album Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park released singles from Meteora for over a year, including \"Somewhere I Belong\", \"Faint\", \"Lying from You\", \"From the Inside\", \"Breaking the Habit\" and \"Numb\".\n\nIt is the most successful album in the history of the Modern Rock Tracks chart, a chart that specializes in radio play of alternative rock songs. \"Numb\" was the biggest song of the year on the chart. The album has sold over 5 million copies in the United States, and over 16 million worldwide to date.\n\nThe album was named after the Meteora rock formation in Greece. After seeing these monasteries on a trip to Europe, the band was inspired by the way they were built, almost defying gravity. It was this feeling of greatness and awesome accomplishment that Linkin Park wished to convey with their music, thus the name.\n\nDon Gilmore co-produced the album. Linkin Park comprehensively rehearsed the album, recording more than 40 choruses for the first single \"Somewhere I Belong\". Like the band's first full-length Hybrid Theory, Meteora was recorded using multitrack recording methods in which each instrument is recorded individually rather than played all at once, as is done in a typical studio setting. In its first week it sold an estimated 810,000 units. To date, it has well over 4 million copies in the U.S. alone, nearly 16 million copies worldwide.\n\nThe music in Meteora represents significant changes since the release of Hybrid Theory. It is characterized by more relevant influences from rap metal (\"Lying from You\", \"Hit the Floor\", \"Faint\", \"Figure.09\", \"Nobody's Listening\"). Their instrumental song \"Session\" was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 2003. \"Nobody's Listening\" featured a small sample from the band's track, \"High Voltage\", which appeared on the B-side of One Step Closer and the bonus disc of Hybrid Theory. The sample was a distorted version of Mike rapping, \"Coming at you from every side\" which comes from the chorus of High Voltage.\n\nThe instrumental track \"Session\" was featured on the soundtrack of the 2003 movie The Matrix Reloaded and on the Season Five Sopranos episode \"In Camelot\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Meteora\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album has been certified double platinum in the United States and shipped over 3.3 million copies worldwide in its first four weeks of release. It is their first studio album with a Parental Advisory label.\n\nThe album debuted at number one in the United States and in 15 other countries, including the United Kingdom and Canada, around the world. In the United States, the album had the biggest first week sales of 2007 at the time, with 625,000 albums sold. The album reached number twenty-five on Rolling Stone's list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007. The album has sold more than 8 millions copies worldwide as of October, 2009. The album is named in reference to the Doomsday Clock.\n\nMinutes to Midnight was delayed several times before its release. First scheduled for Summer of 2006, then Fall of 2006, then early 2007, the album's release date was finally set for May 15, 2007. In an interview in September 2006, Shinoda explained: \"When songs are pouring out you don't ever want to stop that. We already have over 100 roughs for songs. We've narrowed it down since but we're not ready to commit to those yet.\"\n\nFrom the late stages of the demo sessions, the song \"QWERTY\", which was rumored to be on Minutes to Midnight, appeared on the Linkin Park Underground v6.0 CD on December 5, 2006 in both live and studio demo versions.\n\n\"This was a year-and-a-half long process of really hard work and experimentation in the studio that yielded about 150 rough songs,\" guitarist Brad Delson told Billboard.com. \"Not only is this album incredibly diverse, but the depth of the material is really strong.\"\n\nThe first single, \"What I've Done\", was released April 2, 2007, and debuted at number one on the United States Modern Rock chart.\n\n\"Given Up\", \"What I've Done\" and \"No More Sorrow\" made their live debut on April 28, 2007 in Berlin. Live performances of these three songs at the Sessions@AOL were released on AOL on May 5, 2007.\n\nOn May 12, 2007, Linkin Park played \"Bleed It Out\" on Saturday Night Live, along with \"What I've Done\". Also, on May 18, 2007, Linkin Park appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and again performed \"What I've Done\" and \"Bleed It Out\".\n\nOn January 16, 2008, \"Valentine's Day\" finally made its live debut in Hannover, Germany.\nCountry \tRelease Date\nWorldwide \tMay 14, 2007 (2007-05-14)\nCanada \tMay 15, 2007\n\nSONGFACTS\n\n1\nLinkin Park singer Chester Bennington on In Pieces: \"I got divorced recently and that was very difficult. I also got remarried so there was a big contrast in my life. For a while I couldn't be completely happy with the new life I was starting and I couldn't end the last one. This is a song about all of that.\"\n\n2.THE LITTLE THINGS YOU GIVE AWAY\nThis song deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and its effect on the city of New Orleans. The band finished this song after visiting New Orleans after the hurricane hit. (thanks, Bronte - Wrexham, Wales)\n\nThis is one of the few Linkin Park songs with a guitar solo. (thanks, Jake - Albuquerque, NM)\n\nGuitarist Brad Delson in Kerrang! magazine: \"This is our favorite song on the record. It's the biggest statement that we've ever made. Nothing could go after it as everything would get eclipsed by it, that's why it's at the end.\"\n\nSinger Mike Shinoda in the same Kerrang! interview: \"Brad has always avoided solos because he doesn't like to show off. But when he played that solo, though, it was one of the most emotional moments we've recorded. It says what the lyrics are saying without any words.\"\n\n3. BLEED IT OUT\n\nLinkin Park singer Mike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: \"I wrote the lyrics to this about 100 times. it's always frustrating as a lyricist to come in with a new version that you spent hours on and have the band tell you that it's not there yet. in one case, they listened to my lyrics for 30 seconds and told me to start over again. that was pretty hard. it felt like I was bringing in the lyrics, getting punched in the face and then going back to the drawing board. When it finally came together I said to the band 'I don't think anyone but us could have made a song like this'. It's a f--king bizarre death-party-rap-hoedown!\"\n\n4.WHAT I'VE DONE \n\nIn this song, Chester Bennington sings about things we've done that we regret - how we want to forget it all and move on. According to Bennington, the theme of the song is \"admitting to your faults of the past and kind of accepting it and moving on and trying to become something better.\"\n\nThe album title Minutes To Midnight refers to military terms of nuclear warfare, otherwise known as the Doomsday Clock. It is a political statement, but could also indicate the pressure the band was under to finish the album. (thanks, Steven - Anderson, CA, for above 2)\n\nRick Rubin produced this track, and stripped Linkin Park's sound down to give them a more raw feel. Rubin did something similar in his work with Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond. (thanks, Bertrand - Paris, France)\n\nMike Shinoda in Kerrang! Magazine: \"On the other albums, Brad (Delson) and I started every song together (separately). But this was the only song that we wrote together and was the last one we finished. We wanted a song that encapsulated the feel of the whole record and I think this is that song. You're going to get something different out of every time you listen to it.\"\n\nThis debuted at #1 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart April 12th 2007. \"What I've Done\" was the third song in this tally's 19-year existence to begin its chart life at #1. The other two were R.E.M.'s \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" and Red Hot Chili Peppers' \"Dani California.\"\n\nThe album Minutes To Midnight went to #1 in 28 of the countries in which it was released. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Minutes+to+Midnight\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It is also one of the few albums to be certified Diamond in the U.S. that was released in this century. \n\nRecorded at NRG Recordings in North Hollywood, California, and produced by Don Gilmore, the album's lyrical themes deal with problems lead vocalist Chester Bennington experienced during his adolescence, including drug abuse and the constant fighting and divorce of his parents. Hybrid Theory takes its title from the previous name of the band.\n\nFour singles were released from the album: \"One Step Closer\", \"Papercut\", \"In the End\", and the Grammy Award-winning \"Crawling\", which along with \"In the End\" was responsible for launching Linkin Park into mainstream popularity. At the 2002 Grammy Awards, Hybrid Theory was nominated for Best Rock Album.\n\nHybrid Theory was released in the United States on October 24, 2000 following the debut of \"One Step Closer\" on the radio. It entered the U.S. Billboard 200 charts at #16 in late 2000, and was certified gold by the RIAA five weeks after its release. In 2001, Hybrid Theory sold 4.8 million copies in the United States, making it the best-selling album of the year, and it was estimated that the album continued selling 100,000 copies per week in early 2002. Throughout the following years, the album continued to sell at a fast pace and was certified diamond by the RIAA in 2005 for selling 10 million copies in the U.S. In 2007, it has sold over 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. It has also sold 24 million copies worldwide as of 2009, including over 10 million in the U.S. which makes it the band's best-selling album and the best-selling debut album of the 21st century.\n\nCritical opinion for Hybrid Theory was mixed. Some critics gave the album positive reviews; Stephanie Dickison of PopMatters commented that the band was a \"far more complex and talented group than the hard rock boy bands of late\", and claimed that \"they will continue to fascinate and challenge music's standard sounds.\" Q magazine gave Hybrid Theory four out of five stars. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote that “the men don't know what the angry boys understand”, and gave the album a \"two-star honorable mention rating\", citing \"Papercut\" and \"Points of Authority\" as highlights of the album. Jenny Eliscu of Rolling Stone commented that Hybrid Theory had \"as much potency as albums by Limp Bizkit or Korn\" and called it an album that \"reflects the frustration of life\".\n\nOther critics, however, dismissed the album. Allmusic writer William Ruhlmann said that \"Linkin Park sounds like a Johnny-come-lately to an already overdone musical style\" and called \"One Step Closer\" \"a typical effort\", referring to the lyrics of the song's chorus. NME's Noel Gardner commented that \"otherwise damn fine soaring emo-crunchers like 'With You' and 'A Place for My Head' are pointlessly jazzed up with tokenistic scratching,\" giving the album a score of six out of ten.\n\n\n\n\nDespite initially mixed reviews, Hybrid Theory found itself in several “must have” lists that were compiled by various music publications, networks, and other media.

They stated they finally felt they were in \"familiar territory\" and \"comfortable in  own skin\" after years of experimentation that resulted in their two previous studio albums, Minutes to Midnight and A Thousand Suns. Living Things was chosen as the album's title because of the numerous personal topics on the album.\n\nThe lead single for the album, \"Burn It Down\", was sent to radio and released to digital music retailers on April 16, 2012. Living Things debuted at number one on Billboard 200 with sales of 223,000 copies in the United States in its opening week.\n\nLiving Things received mixed reviews from music critics. According to review aggregator website Metacritic, it has an average review score of 60 out of 100, based on reviews from 15 professional critics. Chad Childers of Loudwire gave the album a 4 out of 5 stars, stating that \"the album as a whole continues to expand their world-view writing like what listeners got with A Thousand Suns, but it also adds more of the anger that was prevalent in their earliest work, Hybrid Theory.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Linkin+Park/Living+Things\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It sold 442,000 copies in the U.S. in the first week and debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. The album spawned five hit singles: \"Dani California\", \"Snow ((Hey Oh))\", \"Desecration Smile\", \"Hump De Bump\", and \"Tell Me Baby\". According to the band's frontman Anthony Kiedis, Stadium Arcadium was originally scheduled to be a trilogy of albums each released six months apart, but was eventually condensed into a double album.\n\nStadium Arcadium was critically praised for integrating musical styles from several aspects of the band's career. The album gained the band seven Grammy Award nominations in 2007 including an award for Best Rock Album. It was the most nominations that the band had garnered in their 25-year career. Kiedis attributed the album's success to less abrasive dynamics within the band, saying that the band's \"chemistry when it comes to writing is better than ever. There was always a struggle to dominate lyrically. But we are now confident enough in who we are, so everybody feels more comfortable contributing more and more valuable, quality stuff.\"\n\nAfter the release of their previous album, By the Way, the Red Hot Chili Peppers embarked on a world tour, which lasted from July 2002 to a mid-June 2004 date at London's Hyde Park. The band later appeared at the 2004 Democratic National Convention and at Rock am Ring to tie up their tour in support of By the Way. The band then settled down to begin recording their next album in September 2004 with producer Rick Rubin, with whom they had recorded four albums previously.\n\nThe formation and recording of Stadium Arcadium took place at \"The Mansion,\" the former home of Harry Houdini where the Chili Peppers had recorded their 1991 breakthrough Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Given the house's reputation for being \"haunted,\" guitarist John Frusciante recalled that he felt \"there were beings of higher intelligence controlling what I was doing, and I didn’t know how to talk about it or explain it...it was very clear to me that the music was coming from somewhere other than me. However, Kiedis noted that during the recording process of the album \"everybody was in a good mood. There was very little tension, very little anxiety, very little weirdness going on and every day we showed up to this funky room in the Valley, and everyone felt more comfortable than ever bringing in their ideas.\" The band originally wanted to create an \"old-fashioned Meet the Beatles-like record,\" and to keep the number of songs down to about 13, to make \"a small, digestible piece of art.\" They ended up writing 38 new songs with Rubin, recording them all.\n\nThe musical style of the album combines many aspects of music from throughout the band's career, with many fans and critics welcoming the return of the band's signature funk sound after its significant absence from By the Way. It is also noted that John's playing style had changed from his signature 'less is more' style, inspired by punk and new wave guitarists to a more flashy approach, drawing influence from guitarists such as Eddie Van Halen and Steve Vai. While he received moderate acclaim before Stadium Arcadium, this change in style gained him far more recognition than before. John also began utilizing layering in his guitar playing, which is something he had not done before (many layered guitar parts appeared on Mother's Milk, but this was mostly because of the insistence of the producer, although it was against John's will) and also used a modular synthesizer on many songs after doing so on his 2004 album Shadows Collide with People. While John was pleased to have used the modular synthesizer on the album, he admitted that when the band began rehearsing for the tour, it was very frustrating because many of the songs sounded very empty without it. This meant the band had to rework many of the songs in order to perform them live.\n\nKiedis recalled that the band \"wanted to  on three separate discs that  be released in installments...something about those songs made us really like each one. However, by the time we planned to release the third installment in two years, we’ll be writing new music.\" This was the impetus for the band to pare those songs down to 28, a process Kiedis described as \"heartwrenching.\" All of the 10 unused songs have been released in some form or another (see section on B-sides below). He explained the reasoning behind the decision to name the album \"Stadium Arcadium\" by saying that it had more \"variety and verve compared to its predecessors  we each have things we do best and it’s all in there. Everybody played their part and expressed their creativity to the max.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Stadium+Arcadium\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Californication is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on June 8, 1999 on Warner Bros. Records. Produced by Rick Rubin, Californication marked the return of John Frusciante, who had previously appeared on Mother's Milk and Blood Sugar Sex Magik, to replace Dave Navarro as the band's guitarist. Frusciante's return was credited with changing the band's sound altogether. The record was a notable shift in style from what was produced with Navarro. The album's subject material incorporated various sexual innuendos commonly associated with the band, and introduced themes of lust, death, contemplations of suicide, and drugs.\n\nCalifornication produced several hits for the band, including \"Otherside\", \"Californication\" and the Grammy Award-winning \"Scar Tissue\". Californication peaked at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200. It is the Chili Peppers' most commercially successful album to date, selling more than fifteen million copies worldwide; a revitalization in comparison to their previous album, One Hot Minute. The record marked a change in style for the band; Rolling Stone's Greg Tate noted that \"while all previous Chili Peppers projects have been highly spirited, Californication dares to be spiritual and epiphanic.\"\n\nAfter their 1995 release One Hot Minute, the Red Hot Chili Peppers released Californication, which saw them reclaiming their extreme notoriety among the alternative rock fraternity. John Frusciante returned to the band in 1998 after leaving in 1992, replacing Dave Navarro as the guitarist. Navarro, of Jane's Addiction, gave the band a heavy, psychedelic sound; Frusciante brought back with him the melodic 'punk funk' that had helped bring the band to stardom. \n\nCalifornication gained positive critical acceptance in contrast to its less popular predecessor, One Hot Minute, and was a greater success worldwide. Rolling Stone credited Kiedis for his drastically improved vocals: \" vocal cords have apparently been down to some crossroads and over the rehab, and returned with heretofore unheard-of range, body, pitch, soulfulness, and melodic sensibility.\" Songs such as \"Otherside\" and \"Porcelain\" were called \"Pumpkins-esque\", while the album as a whole was \"epiphanal\" and that the \"RHCP furthermuckers are now moving toward funk's real Holy Grail: that salty marriage of esoteric mythology and insatiable musicality that salvages souls, binds communities and heals the sick.\" Other critics credited the album's success to the return of Frusciante. Allmusic's Greg Prato said that the \"obvious reason for  rebirth is the reappearance of guitarist John Frusciante\", considering him to be the \"quintessential RHCP guitarist\". The album as a whole was \"a bona fide Chili Peppers classic\". Entertainment Weekly also credits Frusciante with transforming the band's sound into a \"more relaxed, less grating, and, in their own way, more introspective album than ever before\". Mark Woodlief of Ray Gun commented that \"'This Velvet Glove' strikes an intricate balance between a lush acoustic guitar foundation and anthemic rock,\" Woodlief continued \"the disco intro to 'Parallel Universe' gives way to a scorching Western giddy-up motif in the chorus, and Frusciante's Hendrix-like excursions at the song's close.\"\n\nWhile many critics found the band's new sound refreshing, NME criticized the Chili Peppers for rarely utilizing their trademark funk sound, asking: \"Can we have our brain-dead, half-dressed funk-hop rock animals back now, please? All this false empathy is starting to make my removed rib tingle.\" Pitchfork, while considering the album a triumph over One Hot Minute, felt Californication lacked the funk that was ever-present in Blood Sugar Sex Magik. It went on to scrutinize some lyrics for being overly sexual, but also considered Frusciante to be \"the best big-time American rock guitarist going right now.\"\n\nThe album received criticism for what Tim Anderson of The Guardian called \"excessive compression and distortion\" in the process of digital mastering. Stylus Magazine labeled it as one of the victims of the loudness war and commented that it suffered from digital clipping so much that \"even non-audiophile consumers complained about it\". An unmastered bootleg has been circulated around the internet. Loudness War Waveform of bootlegged \"unmastered\" version (top) versus waveform of original CD release (bottom), scaled to show relative volume levels.\n\nOver the years, Californication has maintained its popularity. \"Scar Tissue\" won a Grammy award for best rock song in 2000. The album was ranked number 399 on Rolling Stone Magazine's 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time and, in 2006, the Chili Peppers recorded a five-set playlist for AOL Sessions that included \"Scar Tissue\" and \"Californication\". The album produced many staple hits for the Chili Peppers; five of the sixteen songs on their Greatest Hits album were taken from Californication.\n\nImmediately following the release of Californication, the band embarked on a world tour to support the record, beginning in the United States. To culminate the US leg of their tour, the Chili Peppers were asked to close Woodstock '99, which became infamous for the violence it resulted in. The band was informed minutes before arriving that the crowds and bonfires in the fields had gone out of control. When the Chili Peppers performed a tribute to Jimi Hendrix's song \"Fire\" to finish their set as a favour to Hendrix's sister, the disruption escalated into violence when several women who had been crowd surfing and moshing were raped and nearby property was looted and destroyed. Kiedis felt that \"It was clear that this situation had nothing to do with Woodstock anymore. It wasn't symbolic of peace and love, but of greed and cashing in... We woke up to papers and radio stations vilifying us for playing 'Fire'.\"\n\nTo kick off the band's European tour, the band staged a free show in Moscow's Red Square, on August 14, 1999, to a crowd of over 200,000. Kiedis recalled the situation: \"Red Square was so filled with wall-to-wall Russians that we needed a police escort to get near the stage.\" Following the European leg, the group did a show in New York City, at the Windows on the World, for KROQ radio contest-winners, and then at the Big Day Out festival in Australia following several Japanese tour dates. Flea, however, began to feel the repercussions of touring causing the band to set up concerts that were less strenuous, and consequently less financially rewarding, for them. These shows would finish the remainder of the Californication tour. As one of the last shows before the release of their next album \"By the Way, the Chili Peppers played Rock in Rio 3.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Californication\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the fifth studio album by American alternative rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, released on September 24, 1991. Produced by Rick Rubin, it was the band's first record released on Warner Bros. Records. \nThe musical styles of Blood Sugar Sex Magik differed notably from the techniques employed on the band's preceding album, Mother's Milk (1989), and featured little use of heavy metal guitar riffs. The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.\n\nThe album has sold over seven million copies in the United States alone and became the Red Hot Chili Peppers' introduction into popularity and critical acclaim. Blood Sugar Sex Magik produced many hits for the band, including \"Give It Away\", \"Under the Bridge\", \"Suck My Kiss\", and \"Breaking the Girl\". \n\nThe record also marked the departure of guitarist John Frusciante mid-tour in 1992, until his return in 1998.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Blood+Sugar+Sex+Magik\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was during this period of their career that the band became a major commercial force in the music industry. Therefore this compilation includes the majority of hit singles released since their breakthrough cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Higher Ground\" (also included on What Hits!?). \"Higher Ground\" from Mother's Milk, an album released by EMI Records, is included on this compilation through contractual negotiations: when the band switched from EMI to Warner Bros., both record companies agreed that one song from their contract was allowed to be included on the other company's compilation.] On What Hits!?, EMI chose to include the song \"Under the Bridge\" from Blood Sugar Sex Magik.\n\nSixteen songs were recorded for this compilation, however only two were included. The two that made the cut were the singles \"Fortune Faded\" and \"Save the Population\", which was released as a non-radio CD single in Japan and Spain. \"Fortune Faded\" itself was a rerecording of a By The Way outtake that had been performed at some concerts in 2001. A music video was filmed and released for \"Fortune Faded\" but was left off the DVD version. In addition, alternate mixes of \"Californication\", \"My Friends\" and \"Higher Ground\" are included on this compilation, with no explanation as to why. However, the version of \"My Friends\" had previously leaked as an 'unmastered version' of the song (it appears mastered here) and the version of \"Californication\" had been utilized by some radio stations instead of the original track. \"Higher Ground\" appears in a different mix, which may have been Warner Bros.' attempt at remastering the track, or it may have been a rejected 12-inch mix.\n\nThe names of the other fourteen songs are either unknown or unconfirmed except for \"Runaway\", which was included as a bonus track on the iTunes release of By the Way. There are rumors that the songs \"Leverage of Space\" and \"Rolling Sly Stone\", which were included in Live in Hyde Park, were recorded at this time. Also, the song \"Mini-Epic (Kill For Your Country)\", which was performed on the 2004 tour and was supposed to be on an anti-war album produced by Rick Rubin (a project that never came to fruition), is believed to have been recorded at this time. One other song name, which Flea stated backstage at a performance for his Silverlake Conservatory of Music, is \"Desiree\". \"Hump de Bump\" was also worked on for the first time during these sessions, as a jam named \"40 Detectives\". Allegedly, he recorded this on his phone and it was later recorded formally for Stadium Arcadium.\n\n\"My Friends\" is the only track included from the 1995 album, One Hot Minute. It is known that Frusciante and the rest of the band are not fans of Dave Navarro's time with the band, and this is likely to be the reason why other hits from the period, such as \"Warped\", \"Coffee Shop\" and \"Aeroplane\", are not included. Despite the popularity of the song \"Love Rollercoaster\", it could not be included because it was recorded on Geffen Records rather than Warner Bros. However, the music video for \"Aeroplane\" is featured on the DVD version of the compilation. A possible reason for this is that bassist Flea's daughter appears in the video.\n\nAlso absent was the top ten hit \"Around the World\" from 1999's Californication although the DVD contained the music video.\n\nOf their eight U.S. number one singles on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart up to that point, only one of them, \"Can't Stop\", from their 2002 album By the Way, was excluded, though again the music video was featured on the DVD.\n\nTo date, worldwide sales show that Greatest Hits has outsold five of the band's ten studio albums including Mother's Milk and I'm With You, making it the band's fifth-highest-selling release.\n\nIn 2011, Smith discussed the recording sessions for Greatest Hits, saying they recorded sixteen songs and wanted to release a new album of that material after a brief tour; however, by that time John was against doing that because the style he was playing had changed and evolved as had his musical influences. Smith said there is an entire Red Hot Chili Peppers album out there that nobody will likely ever hear. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers/Greatest+Hits\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\"Glue Song\" is a soft and sweet romantic ballad where Beabadoobee expresses the joy of discovering a special person and developing a strong bond with them.\n\nOver a laid-back drumbeat, smooth strings and whimsical trumpet, Bea sings of the exhilarating feeling of falling head in heels in love. Using glue as a metaphor for love, she paints a picture of two people who have grown deeply attached to one another, becoming inseparable in a positive and uplifting way.\n\nBea wrote the heartfelt \"Glue Song\" from the back seat of cars and in transit while touring throughout Asia and Australia. As the first love song she's written for her new partner, photographer Jacob Erland, the track holds a special place in her heart. In the past, Bea's songwriting has often leaned towards melancholic themes, even if the sound didn't necessarily reflect it. However, with \"Glue Song,\" she shares her happiness and positive state of mind, a fresh experience for her.\n\nTogether with her guitarist and producer Jacob Bigden, they recorded the song in his home studio, incorporating trumpet and string arrangements to round out the track.\nBeabadoobee performed \"Glue Song\" for the first time live during her concert in Brooklyn, New York, on October 28, 2022, during her Beatopia Tour. She released it as a single on February 14, 2023 – Valentine's Day.\n\nJacob Erland and Beabadoobee co-directed the video. Filmed over four days in the Philippines, the docu-style visual features Bea's close friends and family, showcasing a series of heartfelt moments in a fly-on-the-wall montage. \"This song feels really personal and I went to my hometown in Ilo Ilo to film the music video,\" she said. \"It's where I was born and so that also added another personal touch to the song.\"\n\nBeabadoobee released a new version of \"Glue Song\" with a new verse by Clairo on April 20, 2023. The pair have been close friends since touring together in 2019 after the release of Clairo's first album, Metal Heart. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/beabadoobee/Glue+Song\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It features guest appearances by Drake, Young Thug, and Savage's cousin Young Nudy. On October 19, 2020, a chopped and screwed version of the album was released.\n\nSavage Mode II received widespread acclaim and debuted atop the US Billboard 200, becoming 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one album. It was supported by two singles: \"Runnin\" and \"Mr. Right Now\".\n\nMetro Boomin first announced the project in July 2019, after 21 Savage brought him out on stage during a concert. Speaking to the crowd, Metro simply stated that Savage Mode II was on the way. On February 18, 2020, the producer tweeted a photo of himself and Savage in the studio. The caption for the picture read \"MODE\". On March 3, 21 Savage reposted a fan's Instagram story that the project would be released on March 13. In May, Savage stated that they were making sure the album is \"perfect\" before being released. The project's release was officially announced on September 28, with the duo confirmed the release date and previewing the album with a horror-themed, \"macabre\" trailer directed by Gibson Hazard, narrated by actor Morgan Freeman; he recorded his contributions onto his iPhone at his home. The visual contains in-studio scenes of the pair, as Freeman informs viewers of the meaning of \"savage mode\": \"'Savage' is defined as 'fierce, beastly and untamed'. 'Mode' is defined as 'a way of operating or using the system'. So to be in 'savage mode' is to go hard, not allowing anything to stop or deter you from your mission. Basically, this means when someone is in 'savage mode', they're not to be fucked with\". The announcement came a week after fans launched a petition urging Savage and Metro to release the album. It garnered over 28,000 signatures.\n\nMetro Boomin unveiled the album cover on September 29 on his social media, with the caption: \"Boominati Slaughter Gang taking over for the 2020 and the 21\", recalling Juvenile's line \"Cash Money Records taking over the 99 and the 2000\" from his single \"Back That Azz Up\". The cover was created by Pen & Pixel, who came out of retirement for the design. It is a \"nostalgic\" and vintage artwork, \"heavily\" inspired by those of Cash Money and No Limit Records and is a nod to the \"bling rap\" album covers of the 1990s.\n\nA promotional website for the album was created, featuring a live countdown to the project's release and a phone number that listeners could call to hear snippets of the tracks.\n\nThe music video for the song, \"Runnin\", was released on October 2, 2020. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on October 13, 2020, as the album's dual lead single, along with \"Mr. Right Now\", featuring Canadian rapper Drake, which was serviced to urban contemporary radio. The music video for \"My Dawg\", was released on October 7, 2020.\n\nSavage Mode II was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 81, based on 10 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.4 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\n\nIn a positive review, Dhruva Balram of NME wrote that \"As a whole, the album is confirmation of two young artists at the top of their game, watching the landscape unfold from the throne they earned themselves four years ago.\" Robin Murray of Clash praised the \"crisp and future-facing\" production from Metro Boomin, as well as the rap performances by 21 Savage. He concluded: \"Savage Mode 2 matches ruthless entertainment to phenomenal artistry, a collaboration that works on a number of levels.\" Charles Lyons-Burt of Slant Magazine said, \"It's Metro, though, who elevates 21's stories to something approaching greatness. ... This sequel is a ratification of the \"bigger and better,\" an example of steady improvement through impeccable craft.\" Rashad Grove from Consequence of Sound enjoyed the album, saying, \"21 Savage, accompanied by the golden touch of Metro Boomin, have given the hip-hop world their most well-rounded project to date, and they set the bar high for others to measure up to.\" Paste critic Trey Alston said, \"Savage Mode II is a worthy successor to the original, building on that initial moment that made 21 Savage a household name. Adventurous, introspective, and thoughtful, it's just what the world needs from the rapper at this moment, even if we didn't know it.\" Mark Elibert of HipHopDX said, \"The Grammy Award winner shows he continues to be ambitious as an artist while keeping up the Slaughter King mantra he ran with early in his career. For Young Metro, Savage Mode II asserts there's no rust on his boards and proves he's still one of the best architects in the game.\"\n\nReviewing the album for Pitchfork, Alphonse Pierre stated \"The first Savage Mode didn't become an ATL classic because of celebrity cameos or Billboard numbers; it was because Metro and 21 were at the peak of their powers, and only the producer is close here. 21 Savage is just along for the ride.\" Steve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews said, \"The 44 minutes of this album could exist without Mr. Freeman, but they couldn't exist without Metro Boomin. ...  a solid RAPPER through and through and in an era of singers I'm always going to appreciate that, but if I said I could ignore the banality of Savage Mode II lyrically I'd be lying.\" In a lukewarm review, Exclaim!'s Jacob Carey wrote, \"Whether they hit the mark with their sequel is debatable. While Savage Mode II is by no means a lacklustre album, it may not be the exact product their fans hoped for.\"\n\nSavage Mode II debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 with 171,000 album-equivalent units (including 22,000 pure album sales). This became 21 Savage and Metro Boomin's second US number-one debut. The album also accumulated a total of 200.1 million on-demand streams of the album's songs during that week.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/21+Savage/Savage+Mode+II\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On June 29, 21 Savage revealed the album's cover art, along with the release date. On July 2, 2017, 21 Savage confirmed the album's producers.\n\n\"Issa\" featuring Young Thug and Drake, was a planned single to be released on Savage's album. On December 19, 2016, Young Thug posted a video confirming that he will collaborate with 21 Savage on his debut studio album. However in May 2017, the original track was leaked online and made many fans unaware of the song being on the album. It is also been confirmed that 21 Savage has scrapped the song from his studio album.\n\nThe album's lead single, \"Bank Account\", was released to rhythmic contemporary radio on August 8, 2017. The song peaked at number 12 on the US Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIssa Album was met with generally positive reviews.

Album of the Year assessed the critical consensus as 64 out of 100, based on 11 reviews.\n\nIn XXL, Scott Glaysher opined that the artist \"manages to craft a fairly concise project with Issa Album about all the things that make him such a compelling rapper in today's hip-hop landscape.\" Exclaim!'s M.T. Richards wrote that \"Savage's strength of feeling against certain people cannot be overstated.\" Corrigan B of Tiny Mix Tapes noted, \"Despite expectations, it's an utter joy to listen to—a simple display of what 21 Savage sounds like when he's having fun rapping.\" Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote positively, \"Issa Album contains some of 21 Savage's best and most fully realized songs to date—especially \"Bank Account\" and \"Bad Business\".\" Justin Ivey of HipHopDX stated, \"The budding star easily could have played it safe and stuck to a winning formula, which remains a strong suit (i.e. Issa's \"Bank Account\" and \"Close My Eyes\"). Instead, he challenged himself to be more musically ambitious. While his experiments didn't produce dynamic results, the positives overshadow the negatives.\"\n\nSteve \"Flash\" Juon of RapReviews said, \"For better or worse the album also achieves a certain bland uniformity at times by staying so true to the trap aesthetic and having Metro Boomin produce so much of the music. It's not ill-conceived, it's just that it all winds up becoming a bit monotonous if you don't randomize it and/or mix in some songs by other artists.\" Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork states, \"He is so compelling when he digs deeper into his psyche this way, providing more than superficiality, but there aren't enough of these moments to sustain Issa Album, which is as basic as its title.\" In a mixed review, AllMusic's Neil Z. Yeung stated: \"Overall, Issa is a competent statement that demonstrates promise from the young rapper.\" Brian Josephs of Spin said, \"Issa Album needn't be The Infamous, but it could've benefitted from a clearer and tighter direction.\" Wren Graves of Consequence of Sound criticized the \"repetitive odes to getting high, getting laid, and getting lots of money.\"\n\nIssa Album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 with 77,000 album-equivalent units, of which 22,000 were pure album sales. On October 19, 2017, the album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 500,000 units.\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/21+Savage/Issa+Album\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album includes the singles \"Checkmate\", \"Comfort Crowd\", \"Maniac\", \"The Story\" and \"Wish You Were Sober\", all of which have accumulated over 92 million streams online.\n\n\"Kid Krow\" received positive reviews from music critics for its production, songwriting and Gray's vocal performance. Commercially, it debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 and further topped the US Pop Albums Chart; also debuting at number two on the Top Album Sales chart. \"Kid Krow\" received a boost in sales and re-entered the charts of several countries when its track \"Heather\" became a sleeper hit after gaining popularity on the online platform TikTok.\n\nGray told People that the album was inspired by his \"pretty rough\" childhood in Texas, explaining:\n\n\"When you're young, it's really hard to imagine life not always being hard. I lived in a really unsafe household, and life just wasn't very good for me. And so, as a kid, I was just like, there's no way that I'm gonna make it, there's no way that I'm going to survive or there's no way that there's going to be anything more to my life than just dealing with pain.\"\n\n\nGray told Teen Vogue that growing up as a child of mixed race in Texas affected who he is as a person, as he felt that \"he didn't really belong anywhere.\" He told Clash:\n\n\"The record is a study of how I perceive the world. I talk a lot about my friends and people I've met touring over the past year. It's me. I'm not the coolest person, but the album is me accepting the fact I'm weird and I don't need to be anybody else. It's also a chance to encourage others to embrace who they are and be unapologetic about it.\" <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Conan+Gray/Kid+Krow\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Previous versions of the song (from the Tumbleweed sessions with Mick Ronson on guitar) can still be found, specifically on the remastered Tumbleweed Connection CD.\n\nWhen it was released in 'The Classic Years' collection, it was the first album not to feature any bonus tracks. One known track recorded at the time, \"Rock Me when He's Gone,\" was released on Rare Masters a few years before. The song was written for and recorded by one of John's long-time friends, Long John Baldry. This was John's first album in which he plays his piano and no other keyboards. This was the first album in which Davey Johnstone played guitar for John, a role that would continue for many years and decades to come.\n\nJohn, Johnstone, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson, who would be the main musicians on the next album (Honky Chateau), would soon join with percussionist Ray Cooper and form the best-known line-up of his mid-1970s band. As with all John songs during this period, the lyrics were penned by his writing partner, Bernie Taupin. This was the last album to be recorded at London's Trident Studios. They relocated to Château d'Hérouville for the next three albums.\n\nThis was John's lowest charting album in the UK after his debut, only reaching #41. In the U.S., Madman Across the Water managed to reach #8 in early 1972 on the Billboard 200, and was certified Gold in 1972. It was later certified Platinum in 1993 and 2× Platinum in 1998.\n\n\naddendum : \nProduction\nProducer: Gus Dudgeon\nEngineer: Robin Geoffrey Cable\nRemastering: Tony Cousins\nEditing: Gus Skinas\nDigital transfers: Ricky Graham\nSurround sound: Greg Penny\nAssistant: Crispin Murray\nOrchestra contractor: David Katz\nChoir director: Robert Kirby\nArranger: Paul Buckmaster\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Elton+John/Madman+Across+the+Water\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was primarily produced by the musician herself alongside Matias Tellez, and features additional work from artists such as Finneas O'Connell.\n\nSonically, it is promised to be a more \"ambitious\", \"mature\" and \"developed\" continuation of the musician's previous bedroom pop and indie rock musical style established in the early EPs Chapter 1 (2018) and Chapter 2 (2019). Lyrically, the singer has described the record as an \"emotional recap\" of the year 2020 in which she explores her personal mental health experiences as well as \"the different sides of love\".\n\nIn late 2019 and early 2020, Girl in Red began continuously teasing and hinting at the phrase \"World in Red\". She told Billboard in September 2019 that this would be the title of her debut album which would be released in October 2020, and that 2020 would be her year of \"world domination\", but this plan was spoiled due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the music industry. She told NME in April 2020, that \" ain't gonna stop World In Red, baby!\" In June 2020, the single \"Midnight Love\" was released as the lead single and first taste from what was then deemed Girl in Red's debut album. \"Rue\" was released as the second single in August 2020. \"Serotonin\" was released as the third single soon after the album's announcement on social media in early March 2021. The official album cover was revealed with this announcement to be a painting by Norwegian artist Fredrik Wiig Sørensen. \"Serotonin\" premiered as Irish DJ Annie Mac's Hottest Record on BBC Radio 1, where Girl in Red herself deemed it \"the biggest track  ever put out\" and \"the best track  has ever written or produced.\n\n1.\t\"Serotonin\"\n2.\t\"Did You Come?\"\t \t\n3.\t\"Body and Mind\"\t \n4.\t\"Hornylovesickmess\"\t \n5.\t\"Midnight Love\"\t \t\n6.\t\"You Stupid Bitch\"\t\n7.\t\"Rue\"\t \t\n8.\t\"Apartment 402\"\t \t\n9.\t\".\"\n10.\t\"I'll Call You Mine\"\t \t\n11.\t\"It Would Feel Like This\n\nAll tracks are written by Marie Ulven. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/girl+in+red/if+i+could+make+it+go+quiet\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album was preceded by four singles: \"Natural\", \"Zero\", \"Machine\" and \"Bad Liar\". An additional single, \"Birds\", was released in 2019. \n\nThe album cover for \"Origins\", along with several pieces of merchandise revolving around the album were leaked online on October 2, 2018. The following day, Imagine Dragons officially announced the album to the public with a trailer. Within the trailer, the band spoke about why they were releasing a new album so soon after their previous album \"Evolve\", along with just finishing the Evolve World Tour in September 2018. Lead singer Dan Reynolds stated that although bands typically take a break for a while after touring, the band had already written songs that felt right to produce and release immediately, as they would be in a completely different place in the future.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, \"Natural\" was released as the lead single. To promote the single, it was chosen by ESPN as the anthem of the 2018 College Football season. The song has since peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its music video starring the band was released on August 24, 2018.\n\nOn September 19, 2018, \"Zero\" was released as the second single. The song is featured in the Disney animated film Ralph Breaks the Internet and was included in its second official trailer, along with the ending credits for the film. The music video, which takes place in an arcade and includes several references to the film, was released on October 23, 2018. The song peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\nOn October 31, 2018, Imagine Dragons released the third single off the album, \"Machine\".\n\nOn November 6, 2018, \"Bad Liar\" was released as the fourth single. The song has since peaked at No. 56 on the Billboard Hot 100. A music video for the song was released on January 24, 2019.\n\nOn June 21, 2019, Imagine Dragons released the fifth single off the album, \"Birds\", featuring Italian singer Elisa. The original album version of the song had already charted in some countries earlier that month. An animated music video for the original song was released on July 23, 2019. In Europe, the song was charted in many countries' TOP 10 radio charts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Imagine+Dragons/Origins+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\"Discovery\" is the second studio album by the French house duo Daft Punk, released in March 2001. It marks a shift in the sound from Chicago house, which they were previously known for, to disco, post-disco and synthpop-inspired house. \n\n\nThe album provided itself as a soundtrack to the anime film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem, which was a collaboration between the creators of the album, Leiji Matsumoto, and Toei Animation. All of the music videos for the tracks on the album are segments of the film. Interstella 5555 follows a story of a kidnapped extraterrestrial band. \"Discovery\" is recognized as a concept album in reviews by New Musical Express and Spin magazines. Early versions of the album included a \"Daft Club\" membership card. The card included a code which granted access to an online music service, which featured tracks later released on the album of the same name and Alive 1997.\n\nTheme\n\nAccording to an interview with Remix Magazine Online, Thomas Bangalter stated:\n\nThis album has a lot to do with our childhood and the memories of the state we were in at that stage of our lives. It's about our personal relationship to that time. It's less of a tribute to the music from 1975 to 1985 as an era, and more about focusing on the time when we were zero to ten years old. When you're a child you don't judge or analyze music. You just like it because you like it. You're not concerned with whether it's cool or not. Sometimes you might relate to just one thing in a song, such as the guitar sound. This album takes a playful, fun, and colorful look at music. It's about the idea of looking at something with an open mind and not asking too many questions. It's about the true, simple, and honest relationship you have with music when you're open to your own feelings.\n\nLeiji Matsumoto supervised the creation of several music videos for \"Discovery\". The videos later appeared as scenes in the feature-length film Interstella 5555: The 5tory of the 5ecret 5tar 5ystem. It was created as a collaboration between Matsumoto, Daft Punk, Cédric Hervet and Toei Animation. The film features the entire album as its soundtrack. Regarding the album from the perspective of animation, Daft Punk stated that, \"We think the music we made on \"Discovery\" has been done in a cinematic way in our minds. We were visually seeing the music and trying to find ideas that were appealing to people's imagination. An animation fan would find this mixture of elements and story in our music.\"\n\nProduction\n\nA significant amount of sampling is present on the album. Rather than simply creating new music out of the samples, Daft Punk worked with them by writing and adding instrumental performance. The \"Discovery\" liner notes specify permitted use of samples for four tracks on the album: Part of George Duke's \"I Love You More\" is featured in \"Digital Love\"; Edwin Birdsong's \"Cola Bottle Baby\" was sampled for \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\"; The Imperials song \"Can You Imagine\" is used for \"Crescendolls\"; Barry Manilow's \"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\" is credited for \"Superheroes\".\nSeveral websites list many other samples present on the album, but Bangalter has stated that half of the samples listed are not true. He also stated the sampling they do is legitimately done, not something they try to hide. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo estimated that half of the sampled material on \"Discovery\"was played live by the duo:\n\n“I play more guitar usually, and Thomas plays more keyboards and bass. There's no ego involved. We don't argue about who's playing what. You can get the sound of a guitar with a keyboard, or the opposite. We don't really care about who's doing what as long as it's well-done. At the same time, when you use samples, you don't have this problem. When you use a sampler, nobody plays on it, so the problem of the ego of the musician is not really there. For everything that we do, no matter how you get to the results, the important thing is the result.”\n\nFeatured artists\n\nThe album features guest appearances by Romanthony, Todd Edwards and DJ Sneak. In regard to working with guest artists, de Homem-Christo stated:\n\n“We met Romanthony at the 1996 Winter Music Conference and became friends. Before that, we mentioned his name on “Teachers,” thanking him for his influences. We wanted to invite him to sing with us because he makes emotional music. What's odd is that Romanthony and Todd Edwards are not big in the United States at all. Their music had a big effect on us. The sound of their productions, the compression, the sound of the kick drum, and Romanthony's voice... The emotion and soul is part of how we sound today. Because they mean something to us, it was much more important for us to work with them than with other big stars.”\n\nGiving his take on working with Romanthony and Edwards, Bangalter stated:\n\n“We wanted to work with Romanthony and Todd Edwards on our first album. They didn't know who we were at the time, so it was very difficult to convince them. When we met Romanthony in Miami, he told us he was very into what we were doing, which made us very happy. They are the house producers who were the biggest influence on us. Working with them was a way for us to close the circle. It was very important for us to do that, because they are part of what we do. Now that we've worked with them, we are free to explore other areas. It will be interesting to see what we'll do next. Now we can work with other people.”\n\nDJ Sneak also discussed working with Daft Punk on the album:\n\n“I went to Paris on one trip, got together with the boys and had a private party at the loft house where Thomas had just moved into  in a rare form of musical display we decided to make beats in front of a few guests. The next few days we continued to work on the music and I sat back and wrote the lyrics to \"Digital Love\". I had written other things but this song was very special from the get-go. I also co-produced the music and they polished it and finished a masterpiece.”\n\nReception\n\nUpon release, critics noted the immediate style differences of \"Discovery\" from Homework. The change in aesthetic was a jarring move for fans of Daft Punk's earlier work and initially caused some critics to pan the album. \"Discovery\" gained praise in later years; the album ranked #12 in Pitchfork Media's Top 100 Albums of 2000–04 and #3 in their Top 200 Albums of the 2000s despite receiving an initial rating of 6.4. In 2009, Rhapsody ranked the album at #12 on its \"100 Best Albums of the Decade\" list. It was also named the 4th best album of the decade by Resident Advisor. Q rated the album five stars out of five, an unusual occurrence for the magazine. Regarding the album's structure, the magazine Spin noted that, \"It feels like a concept album -- in this case, the story of how wine-flow disco circumnavigated intellectual pretensions on all sides en route to a temporary utopia that may finally believe in nothing but the boogie but still has the infinite on its mind every minute.\" NME referred to \"Discovery\" as \"audaciously weird\" and added: \"With its famously camera-shy creators now dressing as funkadelic Power Rangers, it is also something of a concept album.\"\nThe album peaked at #2 in the United Kingdom and #44 in the United States. \"Discovery\" has sold at least 2.6 million copies as of 2005. The album was certified triple platinum in France (in 2007) for shipments denoting 600,000 copies. As a result of sales, \"Discovery\" was certified Gold by the RIAA as of October 11, 2010. Two cult hits were spawned from this album: \"One More Time\" and \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". The song \"Face to Face\" (featuring Todd Edwards) reached #1 on the Billboard Club chart in 2004. The album was included on BBC Radio 1's Masterpieces in December 2009 presented by Zane Lowe, further highlighting the progression of the reception of the album and showing how highly regarded the album is amongst fans and fellow dance artists.\n\nSeveral songs from the album would later be sampled by other artists. Kanye West's song \"Stronger\" from the album \"Graduation\" features a vocal sample of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\". \"Stronger\" was later performed live at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Daft Punk in their trademark pyramid while Kanye West was on stage rapping. Wiley's song \"Summertime\" from the album See Clear Now features a sample of \"Aerodynamic\". Jazmine Sullivan's song \"Dream Big\" from the album Fearless features a sample of \"Veridis Quo\". On February 18, 2011, Trinity Orchestra played the first ever live full orchestral performance of \"Discovery\" at Trinity College. The filmed performance became the most watched YouTube video in Ireland on the day of its release.\n\nIt really is a very good album <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Discovery\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released by Daft Life under exclusive license to Columbia Records on May 17, 2013 in Australia, May 20, 2013 in the United Kingdom and on May 21, 2013 in the United States. Work started on the record concurrently with the Tron: Legacy score, without a clear plan as to what its structure would be. Shortly after Daft Punk signed with Columbia, a gradual promotional rollout began for the album including billboards, television advertising and a web series.\n\nRandom Access Memories pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 80s era of music in the United States, particularly the sound of Los Angeles recordings of the period. Daft Punk recorded the album largely using live instrumentation with session musicians, and limited the use of electronics to drum machines, a modular synthesizer and vintage vocoders. The album also features collaborations with Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. Critical reception to the album has generally been positive.\n\nThis production won Grammy's Album of the Year in 2013, Record for the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance for \"Get Lucky\", Best Dance/Electro Album & Best Engineered Album (non-classical). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Random+Access+Memories\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

With it, Daft Punk apply Minimalism and rock music to their French house musicstyle. It received mixed reviews noting its reported six-week creation, which is particularly short compared to previous albums Discovery and Homework.\n\nConception\n\nThe Japanese edition of the album artwork features a quote from Daft Punk stating: \"We believe that Human After All speaks for itself.\" In a later statement, Daft Punk considered Human After All to be the favorite of their three studio albums and regard it as \"pure improvisation.\" The album's brief creation and minimal production had been decided upon beforehand as counterpoint to their previous album.As Thomas Bangalter stated, \"We were definitely seduced at the time by the idea of doing the opposite of Discovery.\" Human After All was created mainly with two guitars and without synthesizers.Furthermore it was produced in two weeks and mixed in four, a session in sharp contrast to their older material.\n\nBangalter has stated that the album is an attempt to discover where human feelings reside in music. He later commented that \"we felt like the third album was about this feeling of either fear or paranoia...  not something intended to make you feel good\". When questioned on the positive reaction to the use of the tracks in Daft Punk's recent live performances, Bangalter expressed that, \"Human After All was the music we wanted to make at the time we did it. We have always strongly felt there was a logical connection between our three albums, and it's great to see that people seem to realize that when they listen now to the live show.\"\n\nThe cover image of Human After All features the Daft Punk logo displayed on a television screen. Each single from the album (\"Robot Rock\", \"Technologic\", \"Human After All\" and \"The Prime Time of Your Life\") features a cover with a different image on a similar screen. This television theme is also expressed with tracks from the album, including \"On/Off\" and \"Television Rules the Nation\".\n\nReception\n\nWhen the album was leaked on the Internet several months before release, fans speculated that it was a fake designed to foil online filesharing. Reviews noted that the album's tracks were overly repetitive and of primitive quality. Critics also felt that, despite the re-affirmation of humanity suggested in its title, the album remained overtly mechanical.\n\nNevertheless, Human After All is seen as a strange and gutsy musical statement. One review in  Stylus Magazine stated, \"it's the same story, track after track, willfully mistaking alternation for variation, intensification for development and dynamics. In other words, a shining example of pop songcraft in the 21st century.\"\n\nThe recent live tour featuring tracks from Human After All caused people to reconsider what they felt about the album. Pedro Winter, Daft Punk's manager at the time, stated, \"When we put out Human After All, I got a lot of bad feedback, like, 'It's so repetitive. There's nothing new. Daft Punk used to be good.' Then they came back with the light show, and everyone shut their mouths... People even apologized, like, 'How could we have misjudged Daft Punk?' The live show changed everything. Even if I'm part of it, I like to step back and admire it. Me, I cried.\"\n\nThe first single \"Robot Rock\" received moderate attention, reaching #32 in the UK and #15 on the U.S. dance charts, but was not a major hit. The second single \"Technologic\" only hit #40 in the UK but did considerably better in airplay. The track has also been featured on The O.C. and in an iPod commercial. A sample of the track has also been used as the chorus for Busta Rhymes' single \"Touch It\".\n\nHuman After All was nominated for the 2006  Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album.\n\nRemix Album\n\nHuman After All: Remixes was released on March 29, 2006 exclusively for Japan. It features numerous remixes previously unavailable on CD in a limited pressing of 3,000 copies. A limited edition of the album included a set of Daft Punk Kubricks. The album implements a Copy Control system. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daft+Punk/Human+After+All\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Announced on December 7, 2020, it is the final installment of Cudi's Man on the Moon trilogy of albums (which includes 2009's Man on the Moon: The End of Day and 2010's Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager). The 18-track album features guest appearances from Pop Smoke, Skepta, Phoebe Bridgers and Trippie Redd. Production was handled by many high-profile producers, such as Cudi himself and Dot da Genius, who serve as executive producers, along with Plain Pat, Emile Haynie, and Mike Dean, all of whom contributed to the previous two Man on the Moon albums.\n\nMusically, the album's theme finds Cudi fight against his evil alter ego, Mr. Rager, in hopes to win back his peace and happiness. As with the previous two installments, the album is split into four \"acts\": Return 2 Madness; The Rager, The Menace; Heart of Rose Gold; and Powers.\n\nThe continuation of Kid Cudi's Man on the Moon trilogy was first teased in his July 2020 collaboration with Eminem, \"The Adventures of Moon Man & Slim Shady\", in which Cudi raps on the outro, \"The trilogy continues\". Cudi officially confirmed Man on the Moon III in October 2020, releasing a trailer with the caption, \"The trilogy continues... soon\". In November, he tweeted, \"The music is coming. I promise\". On December 7, 2020, he released a cinematic trailer, revealing the title, release date, tracklist, and the cover art, designed by Sam Spratt. Music videos will be released for the songs \"Heaven on Earth\" and \"She Knows This\", the latter a day before the album's release; both videos were directed by Nabil.\n\nAccording to Cudi, the album is, as with all his releases, \"nothing\" like any of his previous works:\n\"My first 2 albums were meant to be untopped. I didn't even think Id live to make another record after motm 2... My point is, u cant top timeless. And that was what we aim for everytime\".\n\nIn addition, the synopsis on the album's back cover reads:\n\"In the last 10 years, Scott Mescudi  has been through hell and back. After feeling like his world was over, he found hope and overcame the darkness that was plaguing his life. But happiness isn't forever. What he thought was peace turns into a nightmare. He finds himself lost dealing with the same pain he had not felt in years. In one night, he must face himself again and fight to win back his soul from the evil Mr. Rager\".\n\nThe album features production from Cudi’s longtime collaborators Dot da Genius, Emile Haynie, Plain Pat and Mike Dean, all of whom helped shape the sound for the first two installments of the Man on the Moon series. In an interview with Zane Lowe for Apple Music, Cudi explained that he was encouraged by his protégé, Houston-based rapper Travis Scott to be more lyrical and made a concerted effort to showcase his skill set as a rapper on this album since he feels he’s overlooked in that aspect of his artistry. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Kid+Cudi/Man+on+the+Moon+III:+The+Chosen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album built on ideas explored in earlier recordings and live shows, but lacks the extended instrumental excursions that characterized their earlier work. Its themes explore conflict, greed, the passage of time, and mental illness, the latter partly inspired by the deteriorating mental state of founding member and principal contributor, Syd Barrett.\n\nDeveloped during live performances, an early version was premiered several months before recording began; the new material was recorded in two sessions in 1972 and 1973 at Abbey Road in London. The group used some advanced recording techniques at the time, including multitrack recording and tape loops. Analogue synthesizers were prominent in several tracks, and snippets from recorded interviews with Pink Floyd's road crew and others provided philosophical quotations throughout. Engineer Alan Parsons was responsible for many distinctive sonic aspects and the recruitment of singer Clare Torry. Storm Thorgerson designed the album's iconic sleeve; following keyboardist Richard Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design, it depicts a prism spectrum, representing the band's lighting and the record's themes.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was a commercial and critical success. It topped the Billboard Top LPs & Tapes chart for a week and remained on the chart for 741 weeks from 1973 to 1988. With an estimated 45 million copies sold, it is Pink Floyd's most successful album and one of the best-selling worldwide. It has been remastered and re-released several times, and covered in its entirety by several acts. It produced two singles, \"Money\" and \"Us and Them.\" It is often ranked as one of the greatest albums of all time.\n\nBackground:\nFollowing Meddle in 1971, Pink Floyd assembled for a tour of Britain, Japan, and the United States in December of that year. In a band meeting at drummer Nick Mason's home in Camden, bassist Roger Waters proposed that a new album could form part of the tour. Waters' idea was for an album that dealt with things that \"make people mad,\" focusing on the pressures faced by the band during their arduous lifestyle, and dealing with the apparent mental problems suffered by former band member Syd Barrett. The band had explored a similar idea with 1969's The Man and The Journey. In an interview for Rolling Stone, guitarist David Gilmour said: \"I think we all thought – and Roger definitely thought – that a lot of the lyrics that we had been using were a little too indirect. There was definitely a feeling that the words were going to be very clear and specific.\"\n\nGenerally, all four members agreed that Waters' album concept unified by a single theme was a good idea. Waters, Gilmour, Mason, and keyboardist Richard Wright participated in the writing and production of the new material, and Waters created the early demo tracks at his Islington home in a small studio built in his garden shed. Parts of the new album were taken from previously unused material; the opening line of \"  Breathe \" came from an earlier work by Waters and Ron Geesin, written for the soundtrack of The Body, and the basic structure of \"Us and Them\" borrowed from an original composition by Wright for Zabriskie Point. The band rehearsed at a warehouse in London owned by The Rolling Stones, and then at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park, London. They also purchased extra equipment, which included new speakers, a PA system, a 28-track mixing desk with a four channel quadraphonic output, and a custom-built lighting rig. Nine tones of the kit were transported in three lorries; this would be the first time the band had taken an entire album on tour. The album had been given the provisional title of Dark Side of the Moon (an allusion to lunacy, rather than astronomy). However, after discovering that another band, Medicine Head, had already used that title it was temporarily changed to Eclipse. The new material premièred at The Dome in Brighton, on 20 January 1972, and after the commercial failure of Medicine Head's album, the title was changed back to the band's original preference. \n\nDark Side of the Moon: A Piece for Assorted Lunatics, as it was then known, was performed in the presence of an assembled press on 17 February 1972 – more than a year before its release – at the Rainbow Theatre, and was critically acclaimed. Michael Wale of The Times described the piece as \"...bringing tears to the eyes. It was so completely understanding and musically questioning.\" Derek Jewell of The Sunday Times wrote, \"The ambition of Floyd's artistic intention is now vast.\" Melody Maker was, however, less enthusiastic: \"Musically, there were some great ideas, but the sound effects often left me wondering if I was in a bird-cage at London zoo.\" However, the public praised the following tour. The new material was performed live, in the same order in which it would eventually be recorded, but obvious differences between the live version and the recorded version released a year later. Included the lack of synthesizers in tracks such as \"On the Run,\" and Bible readings that were later replaced by Clare Torry's non-lexical vocal's on \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\" The band's lengthy tour through Europe and North America gave them the opportunity to make continual improvements to the scale and quality of their performances. Work on the album was interrupted in late February when the band traveled to France and recorded music for French director Barbet Schroeder's film, La Vallée. They then performed in Japan and returned to France in March to complete work on the film. After a series of dates in North America, the band flew to London to begin recording the album, from 24 May to 25 June. More concerts in Europe and North America followed before the band returned on 9 January 1973 to complete work on the album.\n\nConcept:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon built upon experiments Pink Floyd had attempted in their previous live shows and recordings but lacks the extended instrumental excursions, which, according to critic David Fricke, had become characteristic of the band after founding member Syd Barrett left in 1968. Gilmour, Barrett's replacement, later referred to those instrumentals as \"that psychedelic noodling stuff\", and with Waters cited 1971's Meddle as a turning point towards what would be realized on the album. The Dark Side of the Moon's lyrical themes include conflict, greed, the passage of time, death, and insanity, the latter inspired in part by Barrett's deteriorating mental state; he had been the band's principal composer and lyricist. The album is notable for its use of musique concrète and conceptual, philosophical lyrics, as found in much of the band's other work.\n\nEach side of the album is a continuous piece of music. The five tracks on each side reflect various stages of human life, beginning and ending with a heartbeat, exploring the nature of the human experience, and (according to Waters) \"empathy.\" \"Speak to Me\" and \"Breathe\" together stress the mundane and futile elements of life that accompany the ever-present threat of madness, and the importance of living one's own life – \"Don't be afraid to care.\" By shifting the scene to an airport, the synthesizer-driven instrumental \"On the Run\" evokes the stress and anxiety of modern travel, in particular, Wright's fear of flying. \"Time\" examines the manner in which its passage can control one's life and offers a stark warning to those who remain focused on mundane aspects; it is followed by a retreat into solitude and withdrawal in \"Breathe (Reprise).\" The first side of the album ends with Wright and vocalist Clare Torry's soulful metaphor for death, \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\" Opening with the sound of cash registers and loose change, the first track on side two, \"Money,\" mocks greed and consumerism using tongue-in-cheek lyrics and cash-related sound effects (ironically, \"Money\" has been the most commercially successful track from the album, with several cover versions produced by other bands). \"Us and Them\" addresses the isolation of the depressed with the symbolism of conflict and the use of simple dichotomies to describe personal relationships. \"Any Colour You Like\" concerns the lack of choice one has in a human society. \"Brain Damage\" looks at a mental illness resulting from the elevation of fame and success above the needs of the self; in particular, the line \"and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes\" reflects the mental breakdown of former bandmate Syd Barrett. The album ends with \"Eclipse\", which espouses the concepts of alterity and unity while forcing the listener to recognize the common traits shared by humanity.\n\nRecording:\nThe album was recorded at Abbey Road Studios, in two sessions, between May 1972 and January 1973. The band was assigned staff engineer Alan Parsons, who had worked as an assistant tape operator on Atom Heart Mother, and who had also gained experience as a recording engineer on the Beatles' Abbey Road and Let It Be. The recording sessions made use of some of the most advanced studio techniques of the time; the studio was capable of 16-track mixes, which offered a greater degree of flexibility than the eight- or four-track mixes they had previously used, although the band often used so many tracks that to make more space available second-generation copies were made.\n\nBeginning on 1 June, the first track to be recorded was \"Us and Them,\" followed six days later by \"Money.\" Waters had created effects loops from recordings of various money-related objects, including coins thrown into a food-mixing bowl taken from his wife's pottery studio, and these were later re-recorded to take advantage of the band's decision to record a quadraphonic mix of the album. (Parsons has since expressed dissatisfaction with the result of this mix, attributed to a lack of time and the paucity of available multi-track tape recorders). \"Time\" and \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" were the next pieces to be recorded, followed by a two-month break, during which the band spent time with their families and prepared for an upcoming tour of the US. The recording sessions suffered regular interruptions; Waters, a supporter of Arsenal F.C., would often break to see his team compete, and the band would occasionally stop work to watch Monty Python's Flying Circus on the television, leaving Parsons to work on material recorded up to that point. Gilmour has, however, disputed this claim; in an interview in 2003, he said: \"We would sometimes watch them but when we were on a roll, we would get on.\"\n\nReturning from the US in January 1973, they recorded \"Brain Damage,\" \"Eclipse,\" \"Any Colour You Like\" and \"On the Run,\" while fine-tuning the work they had already laid down in the previous sessions. A foursome of female vocalists was assembled to sing on \"Brain Damage,\" \"Eclipse,\" and \"Time,\" and saxophonist Dick Parry was booked to play on \"Brain Damage,\" \"Us and Them\" and \"Money.\" With director Adrian Maben, the band also filmed studio footage for Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii. Once the recording sessions were complete, the band began a tour of Europe.\n\nInstrumentation:\nThe album features metronomic sound effects during \"Speak to Me,\" and tape loops opening \"Money.\" Mason created a rough version of \"Speak to Me,\" at his home, before completing it in the studio. The track serves as an overture and contains cross-fades of elements from other pieces on the album. A piano chord, replayed backward, serves to augment the build-up of effects, which are immediately followed by the opening of \" Breathe .\" Mason received a rare solo composing credit for \"Speak to Me.\"\n\nThe sound effects on \"Money\" were created by splicing together Waters' recordings of clinking coins, tearing paper, a ringing cash register, and a clicking adding machine, which was used to create a 7-beat effects loop (later adapted to four tracks in order to create a \"walk around the room\" effect in quadraphonic presentations of the album). At times, the degree of sonic experimentation on the album required the engineers and band to operate the mixing console's faders simultaneously, in order to mix down the intricately assembled multitrack recordings of several of the songs (particularly \"On the Run\").\n\nAlong with the conventional rock band instrumentation, Pink Floyd added prominent synthesizers to their sound. For example, the band experimented with an EMS VCS 3 on \"Brain Damage\" and \"Any Colour You Like,\" and a Synthi A on \"Time\" and \"On the Run\". They also devised and recorded unconventional sounds, such as an assistant engineer running around the studio's echo chamber (during \"On the Run\"), and a specially treated bass drum made to simulate a human heartbeat (during \"Speak to Me,\" \"On the Run,\" \"Time,\" and \"Brain Damage.\") This heartbeat is most prominent as the intro and the outro to the album, but it can also be heard sporadically on \"Time\" and \"On the Run.\" \"Time\" features assorted clocks ticking and then chiming simultaneously at the start of the song, accompanied by a series of Rototoms. Parsons, who recorded each timepiece at an antique clock shop, initially created the recordings as a quadraphonic test. Although these recordings had not been created specifically for the album, elements of this material were eventually used in the track.\n\nVoices:\nSeveral tracks, including \"Us and Them\" and \"Time,\" demonstrated Richard Wright's and David Gilmour's ability to harmonize their voices. In the 2003 Classic Albums documentary The Making of The Dark Side of the Moon, Waters attributed this to the fact that their voices sounded extremely similar. To take advantage of this, Parsons utilized studio techniques such as the double tracking of vocals and guitars, which allowed Gilmour to harmonize with himself. The engineer also made prominent use of flanging and phase shifting effects on vocals and instruments, odd trickery with reverb, and the panning of sounds between channels (most notable in the quadraphonic mix of \"On the Run,\" when the sound of the Hammond B3 organ played through a Leslie speaker rapidly swirls around the listener).\n\nThe album's credits include Clare Torry, a session singer and songwriter, and a regular at Abbey Road. She had worked on pop material and numerous cover albums, and after hearing, one of those albums Parsons invited her to the studio to sing on Wright's composition \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\" She declined this invitation as she wanted to watch Chuck Berry perform at the Hammersmith Odeon, but arranged to come in on the following Sunday. The band explained the concept behind the album but was unable to tell her exactly what she should do. Gilmour was in charge of the session, and in a few short takes on a Sunday night, Torry improvised a wordless melody to accompany Wright's emotive piano solo. She was initially embarrassed by her exuberance in the recording booth and wanted to apologize to the band – only to find them delighted with her performance. Her takes were then selectively edited to produce the version used on the track. For her contribution, she was paid £30, equivalent to about £360 in 2018, but in 2004, she sued EMI and Pink Floyd for songwriting royalties, arguing that her contribution to \"The Great Gig in the Sky\" was substantial enough to be considered co-authorship. The High Court agreed with her, but the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. All post-2005 pressings, therefore, credit Wright and Torry jointly for the song.\n\nSnippets of voices between and over the music are another notable feature of the album. During recording sessions, Waters recruited both the staff and the temporary occupants of the studio to answer a series of questions printed on flashcards. The interviewees were placed in front of a microphone in a darkened Studio 3, and shown such questions as \"What's your favorite color?\" and \"What's your favorite food?\" before moving on to themes more central to the album (such as madness, violence, and death). Questions such as \"When was the last time you were violent?\" Followed immediately by \"Were you on the right?\" Were answered in the order they were presented. Roger \"The Hat\" Manifold proved difficult to find and was the only contributor recorded in a conventional sit-down interview, as by then the flashcards had been mislaid. Waters asked him about a violent encounter he had had with another motorist, and Manifold replied: \"...give 'em a quick, short, sharp shock...\" When asked about death he responded, \"live for today, gone tomorrow, that's me...\" Another roadie, Chris Adamson, who was on tour with Pink Floyd, recorded the snippet which opens the album: \"I've been mad for fucking years – absolutely years.\" The band's road manager Peter Watts (father of actor Naomi Watts) contributed the repeated laughter during \"Brain Damage\" and \"Speak to Me.\" His second wife, Patricia \"Puddie\" Watts (now Patricia Gleason), was responsible for the line about the \"geezer\" who was \"cruisin' for a bruisin'\" used in the segue between \"Money\" and \"Us and Them\", and the words \"I never said I was frightened of dying\" heard halfway through \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\"\n\nPerhaps the most notable responses \"I am not frightened of dying. Any time will do: I don't mind. Why should I be frightened of dying? There's no reason for it – you've got to go sometime\" and closing words \"there is no dark side in the moon, really.\" As a matter of fact, it's all dark\" came from the studios' Irish door attendant, Gerry O'Driscoll. Paul and Linda McCartney were also interviewed, but their answers were judged to be \"trying too hard to be funny\", and were not included on the album. McCartney's Wings bandmate Henry McCullough contributed the line \"I don't know, I was really drunk at the time.\"\n\nCompletion:\nFollowing the completion of the dialogue sessions, producer Chris Thomas was hired to provide \"a fresh pair of ears.\" Thomas's background was in music, rather than engineering. He had worked with Beatles producer George Martin and was acquainted with Pink Floyd's manager Steve O'Rourke. All four members of the band were engaged in a disagreement over the style of the mix, with Waters and Mason preferring a \"dry\" and \"clean\" mix, which made more use of the non-musical elements, and Gilmour and Wright preferring a subtler, and more \"echoed\" mix. Thomas later claimed there were no such disagreements, stating, \"There was no difference in opinion between them, I don't remember Roger once saying that he wanted less echo. In fact, there were never any hints that they were later going to fall out. It was a very creative atmosphere. A lot of fun.\" Although the truth remains unclear, Thomas's intervention resulted in a welcome compromise between Waters and Gilmour, leaving both entirely satisfied with the end product. Thomas was responsible for significant changes to the album, including the perfect timing of the echo used on \"Us and Them.\" He was also present for the recording of \"The Great Gig in the Sky.\" (Although Parsons was responsible for hiring Torry). Interviewed in 2006, when asked if he felt his goals had been accomplished in the studio, Waters said:\n\nWhen the record was finished, I took a reel-to-reel copy home with me and I remember playing it for my wife then, and I remember her bursting into tears when it was finished. And I thought, \"This has obviously struck a chord somewhere\", and I was kind of pleased by that. You know when you've done something, certainly, if you create a piece of music, you then hear it with fresh ears when you play it for somebody else. And at that point, I thought to myself, \"Wow, this is a pretty complete piece of work,\" and I had every confidence that people would respond to it.\n\nPackaging:\n“It felt like the whole band was working together. It was a creative time. We were all very open.”\n– Richard Wright\n\nThe album was originally released in a gatefold LP sleeve designed by Hipgnosis and George Hardie. Hipgnosis had designed several of the band's previous albums, with controversial results; EMI had reacted with confusion when faced with the cover designs for Atom Heart Mother and Obscured by Clouds, as they had expected to see traditional designs which included lettering and words. Designers Storm Thorgerson and Aubrey Powell were able to ignore such criticism as the band employed them. For The Dark Side of the Moon, Richard Wright instructed them to come up with something \"smarter, neater – classier.\" A photograph that Thorgerson had seen during a brainstorming session with Powell inspired the prism design.\n\nTheir associate, George Hardie, created the artwork. Hipgnosis offered the band a choice of seven designs, but all four members agreed that the prism was by far the best. The final design depicts a glass prism dispersing light into color. The design represents three elements: the band's stage lighting, the album lyrics, and Wright's request for a \"simple and bold\" design. The spectrum of light continues through to the gatefold – an idea that Waters came up with. Added shortly afterward, the gatefold design also includes a visual representation of the heartbeat sound used throughout the album, and the back of the album cover contains Thorgerson's suggestion of another prism recombining the spectrum of light, facilitating interesting layouts of the sleeve in record shops. The light band emanating from the prism on the album cover has six colors, missing indigo compared to the traditional division of the spectrum into red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet. Inside the sleeve were two posters and two pyramid-themed stickers. One poster bore pictures of the band in concert, overlaid with scattered letters to form PINK FLOYD, and the other an infrared photograph of the Great Pyramids of Giza, created by Powell and Thorgerson.\n\nSince the departure of founder member Barrett in 1968, the burden of lyrical composition had fallen mostly on Waters. He is therefore credited as the author of the album's lyrics, making The Dark Side of the Moon the first of five consecutive Pink Floyd albums with lyrics credited to him alone. The band was so confident of the quality of the words that, for the first time, they printed them on the album's sleeve. \"Roger's concerns in it are not out of date,\" remarked Gilmour on the album's twentieth anniversary. \"He did a fantastic job with those words. Then, Roger was always more verbal than the rest of us, who had no great confidence in our lyric writing. Probably, in hindsight, we should have stuck with it: the roots of our problems were being set back then. But we all got the credit and money that we were happy with.\"\nAs the quadraphonic mix of the album was not then complete, the band (with the exception of Wright) boycotted the press reception held at the London Planetarium on 27 February. The guests were, instead, presented with a quartet of life-sized cardboard cutouts of the band, and the stereo mix of the album was presented through a poor-quality public address system. Generally, however, the press were enthusiastic; Melody Maker's Roy Hollingworth described side one as \"so utterly confused with itself it was difficult to follow\", but praised side two, writing: \"The songs, the sounds, the rhythms were solid and sound, Saxophone hit the air, the band rocked and rolled, and then gushed and tripped away into the night.\" Steve Peacock of Sounds wrote: \"I don't care if you've never heard a note of the Pink Floyd's music in your life; I'd unreservedly recommend everyone to The Dark Side of the Moon .\" In his 1973 review for Rolling Stone magazine, Loyd Grossman declared Dark Side \"a fine album with a textural and conceptual richness that not only invites but demands involvement.\" In his 1981 review of the album, Robert Christgau found its lyrical ideas clichéd and its music pretentious but called it a \"kitsch masterpiece\" that can be charming with highlights such as taped speech fragments, Parry's saxophone, and studio effects, which enhance Gilmour's guitar solos.\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was released first in the US on 1 March 1973, and then in the UK on 16 March. It became an instant chart success in Britain and throughout Western Europe; by the following month, it had gained a gold certification in the US. Throughout March 1973, the band played the album as part of their US tour, including a midnight performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City on 17 March before an audience of 6,000. The album reached the Billboard Top LP's & Tape chart's number one spot on 28 April 1973 and was so successful that the band returned two months later for another tour.\n\nLabel:\nMuch of the album's early American success is attributed to the efforts of Pink Floyd's US record company, Capitol Records. Newly appointed chairman Bhaskar Menon set about trying to reverse the relatively poor sales of the band's 1971 studio album Meddle. Meanwhile, disenchanted with Capitol, the band and manager O'Rourke had been quietly negotiating a new contract with CBS president Clive Davis, on Columbia Records. The Dark Side of the Moon was the last album that Pink Floyd was obliged to release before formally signing a new contract. Menon's enthusiasm for the new album was such that he began a huge promotional advertising campaign, which included radio-friendly truncated versions of \"Us and Them\" and \"Time.\" In some countries – notably the UK – Pink Floyd had not released a single since 1968's \"Point Me at the Sky\", and unusually \"Money\" was released as a single on 7 May, with \"Any Colour You Like\" on the B-side. It reached number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 in July 1973. A two-sided white label promotional version of the single, with mono and stereo mixes, was sent to radio stations. The mono side had the word \"bullshit\" removed from the song – leaving \"bull\" in its place – however, the stereo side retained the uncensored version. This was subsequently withdrawn; the replacement was sent to radio stations with a note advising disc jockeys to dispose of the first uncensored copy. On 4 February 1974, a double A-side single was released with \"Time\" on one side, and \"Us and Them\" on the opposite side. Menon's efforts to secure a contract renewal with Pink Floyd were in vain, however; at the beginning of 1974, the band signed for Columbia with a reported advance fee of $1M (in Britain and Europe they continued to be represented by Harvest Records).\n\nSales:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon became one of the best-selling albums of all time and is in the top 25 of a list of best-selling albums in the United States. Although it held the number one spot in the US for only a week, it remained on the Billboard album chart for 741 weeks. The album re-appeared on the Billboard charts with the introduction of the Top Pop Catalog Albums chart in May 1991 and has been a perennial feature since then. In the UK, it is the seventh-best-selling album of all time and the highest selling album never to reach number one.\n\n “...I think that when it was finished, everyone thought it was the best thing we'd ever done to date, and everyone was very pleased with it, but there's no way that anyone felt it was five times as good as Meddle, or eight times as good as Atom Heart Mother, or the sort of figures that it has in fact sold. It was...not only about being a good album but also about being in the right place at the right time.”\n– Nick Mason\n\nIn the US, the LP was released before the introduction of platinum awards on 1 January 1976. It, therefore, held only a gold disc until 16 February 1990, when it was certified 11× platinum. On 4 June 1998 the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album 15× platinum, denoting sales of fifteen million in the United States – making it their biggest-selling work there (The Wall is 23× platinum, but as a double album this signifies sales of 11.5 million). \"Money\" has sold well as a single, and as with \"Time\", remains a radio favorite; in the US, for the year ending 20 April 2005, \"Time\" was played on 13,723 occasions, and \"Money\" on 13,731 occasions. Industry sources suggest that worldwide sales of the album total about 45 million. \"On a slow week\" between 8,000 and 9,000 copies are sold, and a total of 400,000 were sold in 2002, making it the 200th-best-selling album of that year – nearly three decades after its initial release. The album has sold 9,502,000 copies in the US since 1991 when Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales for Billboard. To this day, it occupies a prominent spot on Billboard's Pop Catalog Chart. It reached number one when the 2003 hybrid CD/SACD edition was released and sold 800,000 copies in the US. On the week of 5 May 2006, The Dark Side of the Moon achieved a combined total of 1,716 weeks on the Billboard 200 and Pop Catalog charts. One in every fourteen people in the US under the age of 50 is estimated to own, or to have owned, a copy. Upon a chart rule change in 2009 allowing catalog titles to re-enter the Billboard 200, The Dark Side of the Moon returned to the chart at number 189 on 12 December of that year for its 742nd charting week. It has continued to sporadically appear on the Billboard 200 since then, reaching 900 weeks on the chart in April 2015.\n\n\"The combination of words and music hit a peak,\" explained Gilmour. \"All the music before had not had any great lyrical point to it. And this one was clear and concise. The cover was also right. I think it's become like a benevolent noose hanging behind us. Throughout our entire career, people have said we would never top the Dark Side record and tour. But The Wall earned more in dollar terms.\"\n\nRe-issues and remastering:\nIn 1979, The Dark Side of the Moon was released as a remastered LP by Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab, and in April 1988 on their \"Ultradisc\" gold CD format. The album was released by EMI on the then-new compact disc format in 1984, and in 1992 it was re-released as a remastered CD in the box set Shine On. This version was re-released as a 20th-anniversary box set edition with postcards the following year. The cover design was again by Storm Thorgerson, the designer of the original 1973 cover. On some pressings, a faintly audible orchestral version of the Beatles' \"Ticket to Ride\" can be heard after \"Eclipse\" over the album's closing heartbeats.\n\nThe original quadraphonic mix, created by Alan Parsons, was commissioned by EMI but never endorsed by Pink Floyd, as Parsons was disappointed with his mix. To celebrate the album's 30th anniversary, an updated surround version was released in 2003. The band elected not to use Parsons' quadraphonic mix (done shortly after the original release), and instead had engineer James Guthrie create a new 5.1 channel surround sound mix on the SACD format. Guthrie had worked with Pink Floyd since co-producing and engineering their eleventh album, The Wall, and had previously worked on surround versions of The Wall for DVD-Video and Waters' In the Flesh for SACD. Speaking in 2003, Alan Parsons expressed some disappointment with Guthrie's SACD mix, suggesting that Guthrie was \"possibly a little too true to the original mix\", but was generally complimentary. The 30th-anniversary edition won four Surround Music Awards in 2003 and has since sold more than 800,000 copies. A team of designers including Storm Thorgerson created the cover image. The image is a photograph of a custom-made stained glass window, built to match the exact dimensions and proportions of the original prism design. Transparent glass, held in place by strips of lead, was used in place of the opaque colors of the original. The idea is derived from the \"sense of purity in the sound quality, being 5.1 surround sound ...\" The image was created out of a desire to be \"the same but different, such that the design was clearly DSotM, still the recognizable prism design, but was different and hence new.\"\n\nThe Dark Side of the Moon was also re-released in 2003 on 180-gram virgin vinyl (mastered by Kevin Gray at AcousTech Mastering) and included slightly different versions of the original posters and stickers that came with the original vinyl release, along with a new 30th-anniversary poster. In 2007, the album was included in Oh, by the Way, a box set celebrating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd, and a DRM-free version was released on the iTunes Store. In 2011 the album was re-released as part of the Why Pink Floyd...? A campaign, featuring a remastered version of the album along with various other materials.\n\nLegacy:\n“It's changed me in many ways, because it's brought in a lot of money, and one feels very secure when you can sell an album for two years. But it hasn't changed my attitude to music. Even though it was so successful, it was made in the same way as all our other albums, and the only criterion we have about releasing music is whether we like it or not. It was not a deliberate attempt to make a commercial album. It just happened that way. We knew it had a lot more melody than previous Floyd albums, and there was a concept that ran all through it. The music was easier to absorb and having girls singing away added a commercial touch that none of our records had.”\n– Richard Wright\n\nThe success of the album brought wealth to all four members of the band; Richard Wright and Roger Waters bought large country houses, and Nick Mason became a collector of upmarket cars. Some of the profits were invested in the production of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Engineer Alan Parsons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Engineered Recording, Non-Classical for The Dark Side of the Moon, and he went on to have a successful career as a recording artist with the Alan Parsons Project. Although Waters and Gilmour have on occasion downplayed his contribution to the success of the album, Mason has praised his role. In 2003, Parsons reflected: \"I think they all felt that I managed to hang the rest of my career on Dark Side of the Moon, which has an element of truth to it. But I still wake up occasionally, frustrated about the fact that they made untold millions and a lot of the people involved in the record didn't.\"\n\nPart of the legacy of The Dark Side of the Moon is in its influence on modern music, the musicians who have performed cover versions of its songs, and even in modern urban myths. Its release is often seen as a pivotal point in the history of rock music, and comparisons are sometimes drawn between Pink Floyd and Radiohead. – Specifically, their 1997 album OK Computer – which has been called The Dark Side of the Moon  of the 1990s, owing to the fact that both albums share themes relating to the loss of a creative individual's ability to function in the modern world. \n\nRankings:\nThe Dark Side of the Moon has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all-time. In 1987, Rolling Stone listed the record 35th on its \"Top 100 Albums of the Last 20 Years,\" and sixteen years later, in 2003 the album polled in 43rd position on the magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\" In 2012, The Dark Side of the Moon was voted 43rd again on Rolling Stone magazine's list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\". In 2006, it was voted \"My Favourite Album\" by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's audience. NME readers voted the album eighth in their 2006 \"Best Album of All Time\" online poll, and in 2009, Planet Rock listeners voted the album the \"greatest of all time.\" The album is also number two on the \"Definitive 200\" list of albums, made by the National Association of Recording Merchandisers \"in celebration of the art form of the record album.\" It came 29th in The Observer's 2006 list of \"The 50 Albums That Changed Music,\" and 37th in The Guardian's 1997 list of the \"100 Best Albums Ever,\" as voted for by a panel of artists and music critics. The album's cover has been lauded by critics and listeners alike, VH1 proclaiming it the fourth greatest in history, and Planet Rock listeners the greatest of all time. In 2013, The Dark Side of the Moon was selected for preservation in the United States National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress for being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\" In 2014, readers of Rhythm voted it the seventh most influential progressive drumming album.\n\nCovers, tributes, and samples:\nOne of the more notable covers of The Dark Side of the Moon is Return to the Dark Side of the Moon: A Tribute to Pink Floyd. Released in 2006, the album is a progressive rock tribute featuring artists such as Adrian Belew, Tommy Shaw, Dweezil Zappa, and Rick Wakeman. In 2000, The Squirrels released The Not So Bright Side of the Moon, which features a cover of the entire album. The New York dub collective Easy Star All-Stars released Dub Side of the Moon in 2003 and Dubber Side of the Moon in 2010. The group Voices on the Dark Side released the album Dark Side of the Moon a Cappella, a complete a cappella version of the album. The bluegrass band Poor Man's Whiskey frequently plays the album in bluegrass style, calling the suite Dark Side of the Moonshine. A string quartet version of the album was released in 2004. In 2009, The Flaming Lips released a track-by-track remake of the album in collaboration with Stardeath and White Dwarfs and featuring Henry Rollins and Peaches as guest musicians. Industrial metal band Ministry called their seventh studio album Dark Side of the Spoon as a play of word to The Dark Side of the Moon with reference to heroin, as several members of the band suffered from long-term addiction to said substance at the time.\n\nSeveral notable acts have covered the album live in its entirety, and a range of performers has used samples from The Dark Side of the Moon in their own material. Jam-rock band Phish performed a semi-improvised version of the entire album as part their show on 2 November 1998 in West Valley City, Utah. Progressive metal band Dream Theater has twice covered the album in their live shows, and in May 2011 Mary Fahl released From the Dark Side of the Moon, a song-by-song \"re-imagining\" of the album. Milli Vanilli used the tape loops from Pink Floyd's \"Money\" to open their track \"Money\", followed by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch of Music for the People.\n\nDark Side of the Rainbow:\nMain article: Dark Side of the Rainbow\nDark Side of the Rainbow and Dark Side of Oz are two names commonly used in reference to rumors (circulated on the Internet since at least 1994) that The Dark Side of the Moon was written as a soundtrack for the 1939 film The Wizard of Oz. Observers playing the film and the album simultaneously have reported apparent synchronicities, such as Dorothy beginning to jog at the lyric \"no one told you when to run\" during \"Time,\" and Dorothy balancing on a tightrope fence during the line \"balanced on the biggest wave\" in \"Breathe.\" David Gilmour and Nick Mason have both denied a connection between the two works, and Roger Waters have described the rumors as \"amusing.\" Alan Parsons has stated that the film was not mentioned during a production of the album.\n\n50th Anniversary Edition:\nThe box set features a 2023 remaster of The Dark Side Of The Moon album by James Guthrie presented on vinyl and CD; a remastered version of The Dark Side of the Moon Live at Wembley 1974 on vinyl and CD; two BDs and a DVD featuring 5.1 surround sound mix (2003), Dolby Atmos mix (2023), and a new stereo mix. Other items featured in the set include a 160-page hardcover book of photographs from the 1973 – 1974 tours by Jill Furmanovsky, Aubrey Powell, Peter Christopherson, and Storm Thorgerson; a 76-page songbook of the original album; two seven-inch singles of \"Money\"/\"Any Colour You Like\" and \"Us and Them\"/\"Time\"; a replica of a pamphlet and invitation to the album launch event at the London Planetarium on 27 February 1973; and four posters. The hardcover book and the Wembley live album will be sold as standalone editions. This also marks the first time that The Dark Side of the Moon Live at Wembley 1974 has been available on vinyl and as a standalone release. It was previously only available as part of The Dark Side of the Moon Immersion and Experience editions (2011). <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Dark+Side+of+the+Moon\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the previous year, they introduced three new pieces to European audiences during the first sets of each show. Two of them, \"Raving and Drooling\" & \"You Gotta Be Crazy\", were ultimately not recorded for Wish You Were Here, but re-shaped and recorded in 1976 for the Animals album as respectively \"Sheep\" and \"Dogs\". \n\nThe third would take shape as the album's centerpiece, \"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\". During tour rehearsals for the previous year's French summer tour, David Gilmour came up with the signature 4-note theme and the piece took shape from there. With the memory of former front-man/singer-songwriter/guitarist Syd Barrett fresh in his mind, Roger Waters wrote the lyrics as a tribute to his fallen friend, at the time already an reclusive figure.\n\nIn 1974, it would be performed as one uninterrupted piece. However, during the band's tour of North America the following year, it would be split in two parts, sandwiching another new song, \"Have a Cigar\". A funky guitar-driven piece, it would ultimately be sung on the final recorded version by Roy Harper, as Roger's voice was in poor shape. This song, and the ominous \"Welcome to the Machine\" were written reflecting the band's negative attitude towards the record industry. They also (with various instrumental parts of \"Shine On\") feature synthesizers in a stronger fashion than previous albums, as well as the sound effects (provided by Nick Mason) that are signature to the Floyd sound.\n\nThe title track took shape when Gilmour came to the studio and showed the band the chord sequence, which suitably impressed Waters. He then wrote the lyrics, referring to Syd Barrett's departure and Roger's own growing alienation from his band and from other people (these themes later on would become essential to his story of The Wall). More than any previous Floyd number, it has a very prominent Country & Western feel to the instrumentation (pedal steel guitar and acoustic piano) and the melancholy feel to the lyrics. It would eventually become one of the band's signature songs, and is as of now (May of 2009) the band's most scrobbled song on Last.fm.\n\nTowards the end of the recording process, a stranger who at first looked unfamiliar to the band and the engineers appeared in the studio. After much discussion of who it was, the band slowly recognized him as the man whose story and personal relationship with the group had heavily influenced the record, Syd Barrett. Each member was unsure of what song they were mixing, but urban legend has it that it was \"Shine On\", which adds a new and deep personal resonance to the already emotional piece. Subsequently Syd disappeared from sight, as the band members attended David Gilmour's wedding ceremony that night. That was the last time any member of Pink Floyd had personal contact with their former enigmatic leader.\n\nThe record was released in the Fall of 1975, the band's first on Columbia Records (in the United States, EMI was and remained the Floyd's International label). It became the fastest selling record of their career, topping both the American (certified Gold within two days of it's release and ultimately 6X Multi-Platinum in May 1997 by the R.I.A.A.) and U.K. album charts (Gold within the year, but has yet to achieve Platinum status).\n\nThe band themselves hold the album in high artistic regard, despite the negative and disconnected environment during recording, with both Gilmour and Rick Wright saying it was their favorite. It was the last of their albums in which Rick played an important role in composing the music (making significant keyboard contributions on \"Shine On\"), until nearly 20 years later with The Division Bell. On the band's next three albums, the lions share of the song-writing credit would go to Roger Waters. This, in part with the deteriorating relationship between the band, would cause Roger to leave in 1985, ten years after Wish You Were Here.\n\nTracklist\n1.

It was subsequently performed live, with elaborate theatrical effects, and made into a film.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of their previous albums, The Wall is a concept album — specifically, it deals largely with the theme of isolation from one's peers. The concept was largely inspired by the band's 1977 tour promoting the album Animals, with regards to an incident where Roger Waters' frustration with the audience reached a point where Waters spat in the face of a fan who was attempting to climb on stage; this, in turn, led him to lament that such a wall exists. With its significantly darker theme, The Wall featured a notably harsher and more theatrical sound than their previous releases.\n\nThe Wall is a rock opera that centres on the character \"Pink\". Largely based on Waters' personal life, Pink struggles in life from an early age, having lost his father in war (\"Another Brick in the Wall (Part 1)\"), abused by teachers (\"The Happiest Days of Our Lives\"), nurtured by an overprotective mother (\"Mother\"), and deserted by his wife later on (\"Don't Leave Me Now\") — all of which factored into Pink's mental isolation from society, figuratively referred to as \"The Wall\". Once Pink is behind his Wall, he slowly becomes insane due to his isolation from his fellow man. This culminates at a concert held by Pink, where he sets his \"men\" on fans he deems unworthy. He then puts himself on trial (\"The Trial\") and finds himself guilty for causing his problems. The album then ends with a monologue by Waters; the fate of Pink is unknown.\n\nThe Wall quickly became a bestseller and was eventually certified 26x platinum. It is the Floyd's second-best-selling album after Dark Side of the Moon. However, The Wall contributed heavily to the split in the group that came soon after its release. Roger Waters (lead vocalist) fired keyboardist Rick Wright part way through the recording sessions and assumed most of the creative control over the album. Pink Floyd produced just one more album, The Final Cut, which was practically a Waters solo project, before Rogers finally left the band in the early 80's.\n\nThe Wall is one of the best-known concept albums. With over 30 million copies sold, it is the second best-selling album in the band's catalogue (behind The Dark Side of the Moon), the best selling double-album of all time, and one of the best-selling albums of all time overall. Some of the outtakes from the recording sessions were used on the group's next album, The Final Cut (1983). In 2000, it was voted number 30 in Colin Larkin's All Time Top 1000 Albums. In 2003, 2012, and 2020, it was included in Rolling Stone's lists of the greatest albums of all time. From 2010 to 2013, Waters staged a new Wall live tour that became the highest-grossing tour by a solo musician. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Wall\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded at a number of studios, including guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour's houseboat studio called The Astoria. It went to #1 in the UK and debuted at the top of the U.S. Billboard 200 album charts in April 1994, spending four weeks as the top album in the country. By contrast, Pink Floyd's previous album, A Momentary Lapse of Reason, had peaked at #3. The Division Bell was certified Gold, Platinum, and Double Platinum in the U.S. in June 1994 and Triple Platinum in January 1999. Its release was accompanied by an extremely successful tour documented in the P•U•L•S•E album released the following year.\n\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the Roger Waters-led period, David Gilmour stated that the music and lyrics were in balance, and the importance of the music was understood. The Division Bell's atmosphere is spacier, sounding more like Meddle or Obscured by Clouds than the grittier and harsher tones of Animals or The Wall. David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright stated on \"In the Studio with Redbeard\", which spotlighted The Division Bell (including interviews which were recorded for the world premiere special of The Division Bell aired one week before its U.S. release) that the album was the band's best since their 1975 release Wish You Were Here.\n\nThis release marks the first time Richard Wright had sung lead vocals on a Pink Floyd album since 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon, although he did provide backing vocals for Wish You Were Here, Animals and A Momentary Lapse of Reason. It also marks his first songwriting credit on a Pink Floyd album since Wish You Were Here.\n\nThe track \"Marooned\" was awarded a Grammy in the category of Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the Grammy Awards of 1995. This has been Pink Floyd's only Grammy to date.\n\nEMI concocted an Internet-based \"puzzle\" known as the Publius Enigma in connection with the album's release. Officially, it was never solved.\n\n\nStructure\n\nDouglas Adams, the author of The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy series, chose the name of the album, being a friend of David Gilmour. This came about because the three band members could not agree on an album title (with both \"Pow Wow\" and \"Down to Earth\" being suggested). When Gilmour told Adams about the problem, Adams quickly responded that he had a title, but that he would only tell Gilmour if he would donate £25,000 to the Save the Rhino foundation . Gilmour agreed and the name, taken from a line in the final track, \"High Hopes\", was suggested. The phrase itself derives from the division bell, which is rung in the British House of Commons, and some other legislatures, to signal the commencement of a division (vote) to Members of Parliament.\n\nDespite no specific over-arching concept, there is a musical connection between the songs in the form of a linking theme of communication and the lack of it. Tracks such as \"What Do You Want from Me\", \"A Great Day for Freedom\" and \"Take It Back\" seem chiefly concerned with communication problems within relationships, while \"Keep Talking\" is more generally about the importance of maintaining a dialogue and the dangers of allowing oneself to become insular. Samples of Professor Stephen Hawking from a telephone company advertisement provide the spoken word portions of \"Keep Talking\".\n\nWhile some songs can be interpreted as references to the then ongoing relationship problems between Pink Floyd members, especially the long-standing estrangement between David Gilmour and Roger Waters, Gilmour denies that the album is an allegory for the split and acknowledges only \"a couple of hinted mentions that could or could not have something to do with him \".\n\nAt the end of the album, Gilmour's stepson, Charlie, can be heard hanging up the telephone on Pink Floyd manager Steve O'Rourke, who had pleaded to be allowed to appear on a Pink Floyd album.\n\n\nRecording\n\nWe started off by going into Nick's studio, Brittania Row studio in London, in January 1993 with myself, Nick , and Rick , and Guy , the bass player from our last tour. And we just jammed away at anything for two weeks, just playing anything that we had in our heads or that we made up on the spot. And then we took all that over to Astoria and started listening to all the tapes and working stuff out. We found that we had 65 pieces of music, which we worked on all of to a certain extent, and then we started adding these things. We had a couple of sessions which we called 'The Big Listen' where we listened to all these 65, and all the people involved with it voted on each track, on each piece of music as to how popular it was with them. And so we then arranged these 65 pieces of music in order of popularity amongst the band, and then we dumped 40 of them, and worked on the top 25, which in fact became the top 27 because a couple more got added in. And so the process went on from there with us working away on all these pieces of music and gradually either merging pieces together or scrapping them until we finally were down to about twelve to fifteen things that we all kind of liked. And in the end one or two of them went by the way, and we were left with eleven on the album, I think. \t”\n-David Gilmour, Questions and Answers with David Gilmour\n\n\nReception\n\nThe album was received mostly poorly by professional critics despite its strong sales. Jerry McCully of Amazon.com said of the album in his editorial review that \"The Division Bell is not a great Pink Floyd album, but an all-too-fallible simulation\". Tom Sinclair of Entertainment Weekly echoed McCully's sentiment, giving the album a grade of \"D\" and saying that \"avarice is the only conceivable explanation for this glib, vacuous cipher of an album, which is notable primarily for its stomach-turning merger of progressive-rock pomposity and New Age noodling\". Tom Graves of Rolling Stone criticized lead guitarist David Gilmour's performance on the album, stating that his guitar solos \"were once the band's centerpieces, as articulate, melodic and well-defined as any in rock,  he now has settled into rambling, indistinct asides that are as forgettable as they used to be indelible\", adding that \"only on 'What Do You Want from Me' does Gilmour sound like he cares\". Waters described the album as \"rubbish,\" and mocked Gilmour's decision to have his wife write many of its lyrics. However, the album enjoys a strong positive reputation with Pink Floyd's fanbase. Mark Henderson of the Pink Floyd fansite Pink Floyd.net called the album \"quite possibly one of the most amazing albums of all time\", adding to fellow Pink Floyd.net reviewer Tim Shelton's comment that The Division Bell \"encompasses the best aspects of the band\".\n\n\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/The+Division+Bell\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was self-produced at Pink Floyd's Britannia Row Studios in London throughout 1976. The album continued the longform compositions that made up their previous works, including Wish You Were Here (1975).\n\nAnimals is a concept album, based on the flaws of capitalism. Various castes in society are represented as different types of animals (Dogs as the businessmen, sheep as the powerless pawns, and pigs as the ruthless leaders). Although this album mainly attacks capitalism, several components are similar to George Orwell's novel \"Animal Farm\": In the book, various animals (mainly pigs, sheep, dogs, etc.) represent different roles assumed by individuals in a communist society.\n\nWhile singer and guitarist David Gilmour are only credited for the music of one track, the epic \"Dogs\" (previously known as \"You Gotta Be Crazy\"), this song and \"Raving and Drooling\", a Waters song which would later become \"Sheep\", were created at the same time as \"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\", and originally destined for Wish You Were Here. Their creation process was similar to the method the band used during the late sixties and early seventies. They would adapt and expand their compositions by performing them live, and later in the studio find a more coherent form and concept for the whole album, with Waters writing the lyrics. Animals was the last Pink Floyd album created in this way, as the subsequent The Wall and The Final Cut, were primarily conceived by Waters and worked out in the studio with some input from Gilmour. Although Rick Wright admittedly did not contribute much compositionally, he had some influence on the arrangement of the songs, including solo playing on \"Dogs\" and \"Sheep\". As with \"Welcome to the Machine\" and \"Wish You Were Here\" on Wish You Were Here, Waters wrote \"Pigs on the Wing\" and \"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\" to tie together the other songs in the album's concept. His dominance in the writing credits and the discrepancy with the actual creation process are directly related to the increasing tensions within the band.\n\nThe three core songs are bookended by a pair of love songs written by Waters for his then-wife Caroline: \"Pigs on the Wing, Part 1\" and \"Pigs on the Wing, Part 2\". Both are in stark contrast to the misanthropic middle three songs and suggest that companionship can help us overcome our flaws – though the final lines suggest that the singer is or was once one of the dogs. For the 8-track cartridge release, which looped, Parts 1 and 2 were linked by a guitar bridge performed by Snowy White (subsequently available on White's 1996 album \"Goldtop: Groups & Sessions\"), and the 17:08 song \"Dogs\" was cut into two tracks.\n\nThe giant, helium-filled pig seen on the cover was actually flown over Battersea Power Station for the photoshoot (under the direction of Storm Thorgerson). On the first day of shooting, a marksman was on hand in case the pig broke free. However, according to Thorgerson, this was considered an \"insurance problem\", and he was not hired for the second day of the shooting. Ironically, on December 3, 1976, during the second day, a gust of wind broke the pig free of its moorings. Because there was no one to shoot the pig down, it sailed away into the morning sky. A passenger plane reported seeing the pig, causing all the flights at London Heathrow Airport to be delayed. A police helicopter was sent up to track the pig but was forced to return after following the pig to an altitude of 5,000 feet. A warning was sent out to pilots that a giant, flying pink pig was loose in the area. The CAA lost radar contact on the pig near Chatham in Kent, at a height of 18,000 feet and flying East. It finally landed in a farmer's field, without much damage. They then repaired the pig and flew it up for the third time. The resulting pictures were not deemed suitable on their own (as the clear, blue sky from day three was thought to be much less evocative), and the final image was made as a composite of the power station picture from day one and the pig from day three.\n\nThe album had custom picture labels, using drummer Nick Mason's handwriting as a typeface, as did the lyrics on the liner sleeve. Side one's label depicted a fish-eye lens view of a dog and the English countryside. Side two's was similar but featured a pig and sheep instead of the dog.\n\nOriginally released on Columbia Records in the U.S. and Harvest Records in the UK, Animals was then remastered in 1992 for its inclusion on the Shine On box set. The remaster was subsequently released on its own by EMI in 1994. In 1997, Columbia Records issued an updated remaster in the United States, Canada, Australia, South America, and Japan. Animals were again re-released in April 2000 by Capitol Records in the US, and on the EMI label in Japan, Canada, South America, and Australia again using the 1992 Shine On remaster along with the artwork from 1994 EMI Europe reissue.\n\nThe album proved a success in the United Kingdom, where it reached #2 in the era of punk music. It was also a success in the U.S., reaching #3 on the Billboard album charts (#1 and #2 were Hotel California by The Eagles, and the soundtrack to the Barbara Streisand film A Star Is Born). However, it was on the American charts for only six months even though it has continued to sell solidly, to the extent of its having gone quadruple platinum, according to the RIAA.\n\nIn the UK, the British Phonographic Industry awarded the album Gold (100,000 units) in 1977. It has yet to achieve Platinum.\n\nIn an April 2020 interview, Waters said he had pushed for the release of a remixed and remastered vinyl of Animals by James Guthrie, but that it had been rejected by Gilmour and Mason. In June 2021, Waters released a statement announcing a new release with stereo and 5.1 surround mixes. Waters cited a dispute between himself and Gilmour over a set of liner notes written by Mark Blake as the reason for the delay, and posted the rejected liner notes on his website. The remix of the album is expected to be released on September 16, 2022, on Vinyl, CD, & Blu-ray; also a limited edition deluxe gatefold package containing Vinyl, CD, Blu-ray, DVD and a 32-page book will be released on October 7, 2022. A Hybrid Multichannel SACD of the stereo and surround remixes will be released exclusively through Acoustic Sounds on September 16, 2022, as well. The band released the 2018 remix of \"Dogs\" as a digital single on July 22, 2022. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pink+Floyd/Animals\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Thankfully for Gunna fans, however, the MC we get in WUNNA isn’t all that different from the man who taught us the meaning of drip.\n\nAcross beats from a veritable wish list of can’t-miss producers including Wheezy, Turbo The Great and Tay Keith, Gunna raps in effortless non sequitur about clothing, jewellery and women. He’s joined by frequent collaborators Lil Baby, Young Thug and Travis Scott, and also Roddy Ricch, who guests on COOLER THAN A BITCH, a song dedicated to anyone mistakenly believing that they’re operating on the same plane as he is. Across 18 tracks, WUNNA is everything fans could have wanted from an MC who’s dedicated his career to establishing himself as a trendsetter. In fact, the only place the drip is missing is in the title. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Gunna/WUNNA\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Caesar independently released his first two EPs, Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim’s Paradise (2017), to widespread praise—the first of which landed at #19 on Rolling Stone’s list of “20 Best R&B Albums of 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Caesar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

The album was nominated for a Grammy in the Best R&B Album Category, alongside a nomination for Best R&B Performance with \"Get You\" at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, with \"Best Part\" with H.E.R. winning Best R&B Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nThe album was supported by the singles \"Get You\" featuring Kali Uchis and the double single \"We Find Love\" / \"Blessed\".\n\nThe album artwork features photography by creative directors Keavan Yazdani and Sean Brown. The photograph is Caesar climbing an incline on the Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria, Shumen.\n\n\"Freudian\" received widespread acclaim from critics upon release. In a positive review, Briana Younger of Pitchfork complimented the gospel elements of the album, stating: \"There’s much here that blends well into this 1990s-obsessed era, but Caesar’s gospel background is his not-so-secret weapon. While he’s surely not the only contemporary R&B singer who grew up in the church, he doesn’t shy away from bringing the full range of his influences to his music. Caesar’s willingness to use all of the tools at his disposal—to explore his own id and superego right alongside love’s heaven and hell—elevates his craft.\"\n\nKevin Ritchie of Now commented that Freudian is \"not an album of sweeping gestures, but rather an ambling, pleasant account of a 20-something falling in and out of love. It’s full of small moments, nuance and detail.\" Ryan Patrick of Exclaim! praised the production and originality: \"Freudian isn't about whatever's passing for the genre on streaming playlists, radio or video; it isn't even a throwback. It's a carefully created album rooted in classic gospel and R&B, and a revelation in a world of sludgy alt-R&B, an outlier among overtly soulless genre takes hailed as the next thing because no one knows any better.\"\n\nExclaim! ranked the album at number 5 on their \"Top 10 Soul and R&B Albums of 2017\".\n\nThe album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.\n\n\"Freudian\" debuted at number 25 on the Billboard 200. On September 1, 2017, Freudian entered the UK R&B Chart at number 15, while entering the UK Independent Chart at number 40. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Daniel+Caesar/Freudian\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album has also been described as alternative rock, pop, rock, rap and synthpop, with elements of electro.\n\nThe album's title is a play on \"scaled back and isolated\", a phrase frontman Tyler Joseph associated with the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the music produced at the time. On an interview with Sirius XM, he stated that he wanted to \"lean into being aware that things are scaled back and that we're isolated\". Despite that, Joseph's goal was to create an album that contrasts this very idea and that conveys the opposite of it. The album title is also an anagram of \"Clancy is dead\", a reference to the protagonist of Trench, the band has however neither described this as coincidental nor declined to comment on this subject. The title's initials appear on the cover art for their 2020 single \"Christmas Saves the Year\", on which the sentence \"SAI is propaganda\" is written in purple on one of the wrapped gifts.\n\nThe cover artwork for Scaled and Icy was designed by Brandon Rike, who also designed the cover art for Trench and Blurryface. It features a scaled, teal dragon breathing yellow fire over a pink background, as well as a psi symbol in the top right corner. The dragon is named Trash, and represents \"inspiration, fear, and magic\"; Joseph explained that he wanted to \"tie the songs to something as powerful as that\". The creature was originally drawn by British illustrator Walter Crane in a children's book from the 1860s (the artwork is in the public domain, allowing the band to use it in the album cover). Its usage was also inspired by a small dragon figurine Joseph keeps in his home studio, with Joseph revealing to BBC Radio 1 that it represented an idea that if he were to focus on a single detail of a small room, \"then that detail can then come to life\".\n\nAlthough a departure from the conceptual narrative found on Trench, the band largely continues to examine serious themes on Scaled and Icy despite its upbeat sound. Joseph explained that the contrast was deliberate, stating that \"as you dive into lyrics, a lot of times it's asking some pretty heavy questions and addressing some pretty heavy things\". Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic described the album as \"a snapshot of the emotional highs and lows of quarantine life\", while Augusta Battoclette of Alternative Press noted the themes of \"anxiety, doubt and the need to keep your loved ones close\".\n\nThe album was preceded by the singles \"Shy Away\", and \"Choker\", and \"Saturday\", \"The Outside\" was chosen as the fourth single later on.\n\nScaled and Icy received generally positive reviews from music critics overall. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 70, based on 9 critical reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". The album peaked at no. 03 in both the US and the UK. At the 2022 Billboard Music Awards, it won the Top Rock Album category. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/twenty+one+pilots/Scaled+and+Icy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

In the story, Ziggy wins the hearts of fans but suffers a fall from grace after succumbing to his own ego. The character was inspired by numerous musicians, including Vince Taylor. Most of the album's concept was developed after the songs were recorded. The glam rock and proto-punk musical styles were influenced by Iggy Pop, the Velvet Underground and Marc Bolan. The lyrics discuss the artificiality of rock music, political issues, drug use, sexuality and stardom. The album cover, photographed in monochrome and recoloured, was taken in London outside the home of furriers \"K. West\".\n\nPreceded by the single \"Starman\", Ziggy Stardust reached the UK top five. Critics responded favourably; some praised the musicality and concept while others struggled to comprehend it. Shortly after its release, Bowie performed \"Starman\" on Britain's Top of the Pops in early July 1972, which propelled him to stardom. The Ziggy character was retained for the subsequent Ziggy Stardust Tour, performances from which have appeared on live albums and a concert film. Bowie described the follow-up album, Aladdin Sane, as \"Ziggy goes to America\".\n\nIn later decades, Ziggy Stardust is considered one of Bowie's best works and has appeared on numerous lists of the greatest albums of all time. Bowie had ideas for a musical based on the album, although this project never came to fruition; ideas were later used for Diamond Dogs. In 2017, it was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed \"culturally, historically or artistically significant\". <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Ziggy+Stardust+and+the+Spiders+from+Mars+(2012+Remaster)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The title track of the album became one of Bowie’s biggest hit singles, reaching number 1 in the UK, the US and various other countries. Further singles included “Modern Love” and “China Girl”, which both reached number 2 in the UK. “China Girl” was a new version of a song which Bowie had co-written with Iggy Pop for the latter’s 1977 album The Idiot. The album also contains a rerecorded version of the song “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” which had been a minor hit for Bowie a year earlier. Let’s Dance is also notable as a stepping stone for the career of the Texas blues guitar virtuoso Stevie Ray Vaughan, who played on it. The album was also released as a limited edition picture disc in 1983. Let’s Dance has sold over 10 and a half million copies worldwide, making it Bowie’s best-selling album.\n\nSongs and album development:\nBowie, having just signed with EMI records for a reported $17.5m, worked with Nile Rodgers to release a “commercially buoyant” new album that was described as “original party-funk cum big bass drum sound greater than the sum of its influences.” The album’s influences were described as Louis Jordan, the Asbury Jukes horn section, Bill Doggett, Earl Bostic and James Brown.  Bowie spent a mere three days making demos for the album in New York before cutting the album, a rarity for Bowie who, for the previous few albums, usually showed up with little more than “a few ideas.” Despite this, the album “was recorded, start to finish, including mixing, in 17 days” according to Rodgers.\n\nStevie Ray Vaughan, who met Bowie at the 1982 Montreux Jazz Festival, when discussing the album, said “to tell you the truth, I was not very familiar with David’s music when he asked me to play on the sessions. … David and I talked for hours and hours about our music, about funky Texas blues and its roots – I was amazed at how interested he was. At Montreux, he said something about being in touch and then tracked me down in California, months and months later.”\n\nUnusually, Bowie played no instruments on the album. “I don’t play a damned thing. This was a singer’s album.”\n\nA few years later, Bowie discussed his feelings on the track “Ricochet” (which Musician magazine called an “incendiary ballroom raveup”) from this album:\n\n“I thought it was a great song, and the beat wasn’t quite right. It didn’t roll the way it should have, the syncopation was wrong. It had an ungainly gait; it should have flowed. … Nile  did his own thing to it, but it wasn’t quite what I’d had in mind when I wrote the thing.”\n\nThe album was generally positively reviewed by critics and well received by fans, with at least one reviewer calling it “Bowie at his best.”\n\nThe success of the album surprised Bowie. In 1997, he said “at the time, Let’s Dance was not mainstream. It was virtually a new kind of hybrid, using blues-rock guitar against a dance format. There wasn’t anything else that really quite sounded like that at the time. So it only seems commercial in hindsight because it sold so many . It was great in its way, but it put me in a real corner in that it fucked with my integrity.”\n\nIn fact, Bowie would later state that the success of the album caused him to hit a creative low-point in his career which lasted the next few years. “I remember looking out over these waves of people  and thinking, ‘I wonder how many Velvet Underground albums these people have in their record collections?’ I suddenly felt very apart from my audience. And it was depressing, because I didn’t know what they wanted.”\n\nTrack listing\nAll songs written by David Bowie except as noted.\n\nSide one:\nA1 “Modern Love” – 4:46\nA2 “China Girl” (Bowie, Iggy Pop) – 5:32\nA3 “Let’s Dance” – 7:38\nA4 “Without You” – 3:08\n\nSide two\nB1 “Ricochet” – 5:14\nB2 “Criminal World” (Peter Godwin, Duncan Browne, Sean Lyons) – 4:25\nB3 “Cat People (Putting Out Fire)” (lyrics: Bowie, music: Giorgio Moroder) – 5:09\nB4 “Shake It” – 3:49 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Let%27s+Dance\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was also inspired by his stateside tour to write songs dedicated to three American icons: Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. The song \"Kooks\" was dedicated to Bowie's newborn son Duncan. The album's cover artwork, photographed in monochrome and subsequently recoloured, features Bowie in a pose inspired by actresses of the Hollywood Golden Age.\n\nUpon release, Hunky Dory and its lead single \"Changes\" received little promotion from RCA who were wary that Bowie would transform his image shortly. Thus, despite very positive reviews from the British and American music press, the album initially sold poorly and failed to chart. It was only after the commercial breakthrough of Bowie's 1972 follow-up album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars that Hunky Dory itself became a commercial success, peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart. Retrospectively, Hunky Dory has been critically acclaimed as one of Bowie's best works, and features on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. Within the context of his career, it is considered to be the album where \"Bowie starts to become Bowie\", definitively discovering his voice and style. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Hunky+Dory\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He was also inspired by his stateside tour to write songs dedicated to three American icons: Andy Warhol, Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. The song \"Kooks\" was dedicated to Bowie's newborn son Duncan. The album's cover artwork, photographed in monochrome and subsequently recoloured, features Bowie in a pose inspired by actresses of the Hollywood Golden Age.\n\nUpon release, Hunky Dory and its lead single \"Changes\" received little promotion from RCA who were wary that Bowie would transform his image shortly. Thus, despite very positive reviews from the British and American music press, the album initially sold poorly and failed to chart. It was only after the commercial breakthrough of Bowie's 1972 follow-up album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars that Hunky Dory itself became a commercial success, peaking at number three on the UK Albums Chart. Retrospectively, Hunky Dory has been critically acclaimed as one of Bowie's best works, and features on several lists of the greatest albums of all time. Within the context of his career, it is considered to be the album where \"Bowie starts to become Bowie\", definitively discovering his voice and style. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/David+Bowie/Hunky+Dory+(2015+Remaster)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Despite not being released on that year, Brina took the opportunity to keep teasing new songs and the new album through the music video for “Skinny Dipping”.\n\nThe second single for this project, “Fast Times”, was released on February 18, 2022. The third and final single from the album, “Vicious” was released on July 1, 2022. A few hours before the release of the single, Sabrina announced this album. The album name was hinted at in the skinny dipping music video, along with some lyrics from the album.\n\n\"I started writing emails to myself in the beginning of quarantine as a way of kind of not going insane. And I realized the type of venting emails that you write out, but never plan on sending are the most authentic, real part of your brain that you can capture in that moment, because you’re not worried about how people are going to hear it or how they’re going to perceive you after they hear it… So, basically, the songs that I’ve been writing for the last year have come from the starts of those emails.\n\nI’ve learned a lot and, essentially, this next record for me, feels like the first one where I am myself… I just think that there’s a lot that I’ve learned and now a lot that I can kind of honestly reflect and look back on and see things with clear eyes and see people’s intentions with clear eyes and see moments where I could have gone left instead of right. And if it would’ve made a difference, doesn’t matter, you can’t change that. But it’s been that combined with, you said this earlier, but the music that I grew up on and how that’s really shaped me and working with these people that understand music better than anyone. And I think that it’s been a really beautiful, just fun process, which is all I could ever ask for.\"\n\n- via “At Home With” on Apple Music 1 <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sabrina+Carpenter/emails+i+can%27t+send\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

After finishing third in the seventh series of British reality singing contest The X Factor in December 2010, One Direction began recording the album in Sweden, UK and the United States, working with a variety of writers and producers. The album is predominantly a pop music album, which orientates into pop rock, dance-pop, teen pop and power pop. The album's lyrical content explores themes about having fun, being young, relationships, heartbreak and empowerment. Staged in support of the album, One Direction performed the album's songs live on televised shows, at awards ceremonies, and during their worldwide Up All Night Tour.\n\nThe album received generally favourable reviews from contemporary music critics, many of whom appreciated the album's combination of melodic song craft and catchy, pop-oriented material that, while slickly produced, avoided the commercial cynicism and adult contemporary posturing of some of their '80s and '90s forebears. An international success, the album topped the charts in sixteen countries and sold over 3.6 million copies worldwide by December 2012. The album bowed at number two on the UK Albums Chart and ultimately became the UK's fastest-selling debut album of 2011. Up All Night went straight to number one on the United States Billboard 200, selling 176,000 copies in its first week, making One Direction the first British group in US chart history to achieve this feat with their debut album. They were inducted into the Guinness World Records as a result.\n\nOne Direction finished 2012 with two of that year's top five best-selling albums in the United States; Up All Night at number three (1,616,000) and their second studio album Take Me Home at number five (1,340,000), making the vocal quintet the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era. In addition, Up All Night became the best-selling album by a group and the best-selling debut album of 2012. Four singles were released from the album, including the UK Singles Chart top ten hits — \"What Makes You Beautiful\", \"Gotta Be You\", and \"One Thing\". With over 5 million copies sold worldwide, \"What Makes You Beautiful\" is among the best-selling singles of all time. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/Up+All+Night\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The album debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200, making One Direction the first group in history to debut at number one in the US with their first three albums. Despite being released five weeks before the year's end, Midnight Memories nevertheless became the best-selling album of 2013 as listed by the IFPI, with sales of four million copies. The album was preceded by the release of the singles \"Best Song Ever\" and \"Story of My Life\".\n\nUpon the album's release, Midnight Memories received mixed reviews from music critics. Many critics praised the lyrical depth and musical composition on the album, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process. However, others argued that the material was less memorable than their previous work and felt the themes were not as mature as expected. To promote the album, One Direction embarked on their third and first stadium concert tour, entitled the Where We Are Tour in 2014. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/Midnight+Memories+(Deluxe)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

On 22 September, the title for the fifth studio album, Made in the A.M., was officially announced along with promotional single \"Infinity\" being released. The group began to reveal the track listing on their Snapchat stories to which it was later confirmed on iTunes.\n\nJulian Bunetta, the producer/songwriter behind many of the group’s singles, told Billboard that One Direction’s fifth album was recorded with the four members knowing it would be their last for a while. “There was a feeling of, ‘Well, we’re going to take a break, and anything in the world can happen during that time off,’ adding “There’s a song about losing someone that isn’t Zayn. There’s also a song about the band being on shaky ground and not knowing what the future is. There are songs about love, there’s a song that is a little more sexually charged. It’s all over the map.” <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/One+Direction/Made+in+the+A.M.+(Deluxe+Edition)\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Yung Lean specifically mentions the influence of works such as Robert W. Chambers' The King in Yellow, Yukio Mishima’s The Temple of the Golden Pavillion, along with the writings of Roberto Bolaño, Julio Cortázar, and Edgar Allen Poe in this interview with DAZED.\n\nOf particular influence seems to be the Chambers series of short stories The King in Yellow. In these stories, a recurring motif appears centering around the supernatural effects of a fictional play that causes madness when read, also titled The King in Yellow. One of the main characters in this fictitious play is known as ‘The Stranger’, famous for the following back-and-forth with the two other main characters Camilla and Cassilda:\n\nCamilla: You, sir, should unmask.\nStranger: Indeed?\nCassilda: Indeed it’s time. We have all laid aside disguise but you.\nStranger: I wear no mask.\nCamilla: (Terrified, aside to Cassilda.) No mask?

It was released Internationally in 2007, two years after it was originally released. The album received a 2009 Grammy Awards nomination for Best Electronic/Dance Album in 2009. Five singles were released from the album: \"Be Mine!\", \"Who's That Girl\", UK number one song \"With Every Heartbeat\", \"Konichiwa Bitches\" and \"Handle Me\".\n\nRobyn debuted at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart, becoming Robyn's first number-one album in her home country. The album spent thirty-six weeks altogether on the chart, and was certified platinum on 6 April 2006 for sales in excess of 40,000 copies in Sweden. The album reached the number thirty-five in Norway, and remained on the albums chart for one week. Although the album had charted only in Sweden and Norway, it reached number sixty on the European Top 100 Albums chart on the issue dated 21 May 2005. It became Robyn's first album to chart on the UK Albums Chart, where it debuted at number twenty on 19 August 2007, before peaking at number nineteen the following week. On 13 January 2008, the album re-entered the top forty at number eighteen, and eventually climbed to number eleven three weeks later. On 14 September 2007, Robyn was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), having sold 242,000 copies in the UK as of June 2010. The album reached a new peak position of number forty-eight on the European Top 100 Albums chart dated 16 January 2008.\n\nIn 2007, Robyn signed a North American distribution deal with Interscope Records. She was asked by Interscope to include a rapper on the album to highlight its hip hop elements. In an interview with Metro Sweden, Robyn said she understood why the label wants her to include a rapper, but did not want to \"work with Akon or some other lame rapper. I want to work with someone who's gangsta, like Snoop  or Method Man\". On 29 April 2008, Robyn was finally released in North America and debuted at number 100 on the Billboard 200, selling 7,000 copies in its first week. It would only spend one week on the charts, and had sold 33,000 copies in the US by June 2010. \"Dream On\" later appeared on the North American release of Robyn without Ola Salo's vocals. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robyn/Robyn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Early on, she reached out to Joseph Mount of Metronomy, and they kept collaborating beyond the expected one-off session. Mount said he had to adjust to Robyn's \"emotional transparency\" while writing, understanding over time that it is \"integral to what she does\".\n\nRobyn has stated that the album, recorded in part at studios in Stockholm, London, Paris, New York and Ibiza, features \"much more production work on my end\". She also said the album represents \"this sweet place, like a very soft ecstasy.  I danced a lot when I was making it. I found a sensuality and a softness that I don't think I was able to use in the same way before. Everything just became softer.\"\nRobyn initially began working on the record alone, which she said allowed her to be more sensual. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robyn/Honey\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His first album, \"Låtar som är sådar\", was only spread among friends at first, back in 1996, but as rumour spread it became famous enough for a record label to distribute it in 1997. Within a year 110,000 copies were sold.\n\nAccompanied by a band consisting of brothers and friends, Björn has released six albums by now - one of them being a collection (in 2003).\n\nHis lyrics are centered around humor. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Bj%C3%B6rn+Rosenstr%C3%B6m\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

According to the band, the name Mando Diao has no meaning at all, but rather appeared to band member Björn Dixgård in a dream. Their sound is influenced by The Animals and Oasis.\n\nThe roots of Mando Diao date back to 1995 when Björn Dixgård was a member of a band called Butler. Band members came and went;  four years later, the remaining line-up chose to proceed more seriously in their musical efforts. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mando+Diao\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

Then without any outside influences the whole band set the lyrics to music.\nLike in every album in \"Give Me Fire\" the band recreated itself, but still in their individual, typical Mandostyle. It sounds like coming right from the sixties. Partly consciously and partly unconsciously they added elements of Latin, Soul, Disco and Retro to their normal Garage-Indie-Rocksound. \nCharacteristically for \"Give Me Fire\" is the difference between all tracks, which still follow a well considered common conception. This makes listening to the sounds of this album like watching a sweeping motion picture. \nMando Diao focused a lot on the musical version. The backing vocals are often sung by women and extraordinary instruments like violins, trumpets and harmonicas are supporting the booming bass. But in some songs, \"Crystal\" for example, they work with about 8 guitars. \nIt is surely worth it listening to the igneous sounds of “Give Me Fire”, so come on come on, put your high heels on and buy this record.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mando+Diao/Give+Me+Fire\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

                    "content": "\n\nThose already familiar with First Aid Kit may be shocked by the portent in the title of their second album, The Lion's Roar. For a duo so built on understatement, it's a statement of its own volition – words which suggest something bigger, bolder, and stronger.\n\nFrom the reflections of Blue, the influence of the Swedish sisters' dream producer Mike Mogis (best known for his work with Bright Eyes) becomes apparent. Still pared down but clearer, the sweet mimicking between bass and xylophone feel more ominous than decorative.\n\nJohanna and Klara Sodenberg's close harmonies charm unaffectedly, pitched in the mix like the faint voices of songbirds echoing through a woodland scene. And, lyrically, there's a mix of gloom and lilt in the perfect order and proportion; in spite of Conor Oberst's involvement, there's no stagnation, no lack of positivity and certainly no halting moments of impenetrable self-reflection.\n\nThe voices gallingly cry \"I go from nowhere to nowhere / Searching for the key\" on Dance to Another Tune, the most mournful of The Lion's Roar's 10 songs. Written like a series of proverbs, it has the unique gift of being accessible and extravagant. First Aid Kit are now a band rather than a duo, and the gorgeous harmonies benefit from a more serious direction and sometimes sweeping orchestration.\n\nFirst Aid Kit's journey into the hillbilly backwoods is smoother than their rickety debut album, 2010’s The Big Black & Blue, and comes with the benefit of greater knowledge. This set swells into a full assembly of Americana, peaking at name-dropper Emmylou – the delightful warmth of this song can be attributed to the sisters' affections for the genre, even down to the accents. The lyrics \"I'll be your Emmylou and I'll be your June / And you'll be my Gram and your Johnny too,\" while simple, act as a gently vigorous call-to-arms.\n\nThe echo of pedal steel and mariachi horns on King of the World is a far cry from First Aid Kit's cover of Fleet Foxes’ Tiger Mountain Peasant Song, which first appeared on YouTube in 2008. The full band which appears on The Lion's Roar enjoys the rare achievement of being saccharine-free, and serves to highlight the sisters' brilliant captured-on-tape chemistry.\n\nAs consolation anthems go, it's difficult to imagine anyone topping this collection in 2012. Sat neatly between Laura Marling's trauma, Alessi's Ark's florid scenes and Joni Mitchell's spot-lit thoughts, First Aid Kit's second album lines them up as the band most likely to cross over into the big time.\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/First+Aid+Kit/The+Lion%27s+Roar\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Commendable, but given the pressure on any artist to perform well commercially – different targets for different troupes, granted, but targets nonetheless – perhaps a little naively idealistic.\n\nThe Big Black & the Blue is, expectedly, not an album that will top any countdown this side of a dramatic and unforeseen folk revolution. First Aid Kit’s debut is all delicate picks and humble strums, where many girls its makers’ age – they were born in 1990 and 1993 – match their pulses to the skip-along sounds of the pop Top 40. Though the Söderbergs once sang along to Britney hits, their original fare is of the world-weary, heavy-hearted variety; disregard acknowledgment of their age and one could assume these voices sing from experience, not fanciful imagination.\n\nIt’s also tough to trace the roots of this material to Scandinavia’s fertile musical soil, as its primary touchstones are artists exclusively of stateside lineage – the bruised, soul-exposed lo-fi Americana of Bill Callahan; Cat Power’s spare, smoke-trail-detailed evocations; the soft-focus dynamics of Midlake and Fleet Foxes. As such questions can be posed, as to the ‘authenticity’ of First Aid Kit’s repertoire; but so finely accomplished is the sisters’ execution that doubts are soon dismissed.\n\nWhile songs are, at times, little more than sketches – embellishments are at a premium, much on offer bare-boned and probably better for it – there’s only ever one element that’s properly illuminated: the vocals. And the sisters can sing, wonderfully so, uncommon richness wrapping itself around syllables drawled with all the ache of an individual battered by the conflicts of love, but stubbornly still standing. They can hold the listener in a trance-like state, the grip only broken when a sharp acoustic cuts the cord to mark the arrival of another song. \n\nFamiliarity does threaten to impose itself, as structures vary little from number to number, a template adhered to tightly. But these 11 tracks wisely elect not to outstay their welcome, ensuring that repeat experiences are enjoyable, if not markedly memorable.

The album was produced by longtime collaborator Magnus Skylstad and herself during the COVID-19 pandemic. Features French singer Pomme on track Everything Matters.\n\n“The Greeks had gods and goddesses for everything. For anxiety, for wine, for sex… Long ago when this concept of gods and goddesses started they were more human, more relatable, and almost touchable. Most importantly, they had flaws.” – AURORA about her album.\n\nAURORA started writing for the album in January 2019. She started talking about a new album shortly after releasing A Different Kind Of Human – Step 2, mentioning a possible 2020 release. On October 28, 2019, AURORA mentioned that she asw working on two albums at the same time, one of which she has said is \"longer into the future.\" She then talked about the closer one, saying: \"The perspective is much bigger. It's still quite political, and it's still quite opinionated and it's also very emotional. It's even more about the individuals that make the army. It's an album for every individual within the big army of love.“ On December 3, 2019, AURORA revealed more information saying: \"My next album will be dressed in an armor of hardness. But I'm also really exploring the soft, delicate part of me, which I want to open up even more on my next album.\"\n\nOn May 11, 2020, AURORA archived all her Instagram posts, and then, posted about a new song about love and a new era. The next day, she announced the album's originally-intended first single, Exist For Love, sharing that it was the beginning of Chapter 3. It was officially released on May 14th, 2020.\n\nCure For Me was released on July 7, 2021, replacing Exist For Love as the album's lead single. The day before, AURORA did an interview with Berges Tidende where she stated that her new album is finished, saying \"before I left home, I listened to the latest version and approved it\". A snippet of the Exist For Love music video was shown in the Cure For Me video, further supporting the song remaining on the album.\n\nOn October 11, AURORA announced Giving In To The Love as the album's third official single. It was released worldwide on October 14, 2021. The album was officially announced at the time of the single's release.\n\nOn December 3rd, the promo single, Heathens was released by surprise and soon after a live performance video of the song was published. A livestreamed show, \"A Touch Of The Divine\", was announced, planned for January 25, 2022, shortly after the album release. About this show AURORA said: \"it's gonna sound different live than it's gonna be on the livestream  to kind of wrap the music in different ways.\"\n\nOn January 5, 2022, AURORA announced a new upcoming single Instagram, tagging French singer-songwriter Pomme in the post, who did the same on her Instagram. On January 7th, A Dangerous Thing and Everything Matters were released as a single (titled after the first song).\n\nThe store-exclusive 'standard' and white vinyl editions feature an alternative track listing; their track positions are different and The Woman I Am and The Devil Is Human are included, replacing Giving In To The Love and You Keep Me Crawling from the other editions.\n\nThe album commercially obtained a good performance in International lists. It was the singer's second number #1 album in Norway (2,300 copies) and her first top 10 in the UK (4,000 copies), respectively. The album also charted in Belgium, Austria, Australia, the Netherlands, Finland, Germany, Spain, Scotland, Poland, Switzerland and the United States. It is estimated to have sold over 25,000 copies worldwide in its first week.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 9 reviews.\n\nIn the 2021 edition of the P3 Gull (Norwegian Awards) AURORA was nominated for Artist of the Year, but ended up losing to singer Chris Holsten. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aurora/The+Gods+We+Can+Touch\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was released on June 7, 2019 by Decca and Glassnote Records. It is the successor to the first chapter and the previous chapter of the album Infections Of A Different Kind - Step 1, which was released in September 2018.\n\n\"My first album was a lot about looking inwards and working with your own demons, becoming a warrior for yourself. All in all, it’s about becoming a warrior for the people that can’t be a warrior for themselves yet, so that’s why it’s important that this album felt like it was sent to a different kind of human. It has this mix of the ancient and futuristic because we are in a very interesting time now, as humans; we are trying to learn how to live with the world, the technology, with us, and trying to balance it all in harmony.\" — AURORA describing the concepts for \"A Different Kind Of Human\" and the inspirations it took from her debut album.\n\nOn her second album, Norwegian singer-songwriter and electronic producer AURORA celebrates individual imperfection and the quest to evolve. “We have come here for you,” she chants on the title track, imagining aliens on a mothership retrieving someone too “pure” for this world so they can live in contentment. It’s at once wide-eyed science fiction and a grand metaphor worthy of Kate Bush, and AURORA is particularly good at putting intriguing interpretations into conversation with each other. Raised in the forested countryside on Norway’s west coast, the musician and vocalist creates synthesizer parts that burble, build, and ultimately stand unbowed—opening track The River reaches a panoramic sweep as the layered vocal parts intertwine. There are hints of Robyn’s coolly contained judgments and Björk’s nature-infused grooves, but AURORA’s follow-up to 2018’s Infections Of A Different Kind - Step 1 has a distinct mix of mood and momentum that reaches a peak on the environmental elegy The Seed. The album is often uplifting, stemming from a purposeful outlook that makes these songs feel like they’re the soundtrack to life’s turning points.\n\nOn the same day of the release of Infections Of A Different Kind - Step 1, AURORA confirmed in an interview with NME that Step 2 would be released either in 2019 or 2020. Months after, AURORA posted a photo which seems to be an alien invasion with a text that said \"Something is coming in 2019\" in Morse code, hinting that Step 2 would be set to release in 2019.\n\nOn December 24, 2018, AURORA announced in an interview for Bergen Tindende that Step 2 was coming faster than expected, most likely because she and Magnus Skylstad had been in the studio for a very long time.\n\nThe first single for the album confirmed to be Animal, which was released on January 24, 2019.\n\nOn February 18, 2019, AURORA announced that the title would not be under the assumed title of Infections of a Different Kind - Step 2, but that it would have a different name. \"It's kind of what I would hope for the music to do to us.\"\n\nOn March 12, 2019, in an interview on B-Sides On-Air, AURORA confirmed Step 2 had already been recorded since November 2018. Then in the end of March, The Seed was confirmed to be the second single from the project. The album title and track list were revealed on April 4, 2019.\n\nOn May 10, 2019, The River was released as the album's third single, and the song A Different Kind of Human was released as the album's first promotional single on May 31, 2019.\n\nOn Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews and ratings from mainstream publications, A Different Kind Of Human - Step 2 received an average score of 77, based on 7 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"\n\n\"A Different Kind Of Human - Step II\" debuted at number #4 on the Norwegian album chart and at #32 on UK Charts (OCC). The album also debuted on the album charts in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Germany, Scotland and Switzerland.\n\nIn September 2020, a Japanese version of the album was released, featuring Infections Of A Different Kind – Step 1, an acoustic version of The River and the single Exist For Love as bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aurora/A+Different+Kind+of+Human+%E2%80%93+Step+2\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Surprise-released on September 28, 2018, the album features eight songs that address issues such as domestic violence, global warming, connection/connectivity and fear of intimacy. The title being that of the eighth track, which AURORA declared as \"the most important song I've ever written\".\n\nOn the day of releasing her debut All My Demons Greeting Me As A Friend, she said that it was \"the first album of many\" that she has planned. As of May 12, 2016, after coming back from her European tour, AURORA announced that she was ready to begin writing and producing more material, which eventually formed her second studio album. She has said in a Facebook event that she has 15 demo songs and has written 1,000 songs/poems. According to AURORA, her second album was expected to be released in the fourth quarter of 2018.\n\nBetween 2017 and 2018, AURORA presented eleven new live performances: Queendom, All Is Soft Inside, Soft Universe, Churchyard, The Seed, In Bottles, Feeling and Animal. Two other tracks, Cocoon (formerly known as \"Ocean Rose\") and Wavelengths, were cited by AURORA among those composed and recorded during the 2017 \"Bergen Song\", a songwriting and songwriting camp held annually at eponymous city. The singer also stated, between the end of 2017 and the beginning of 2018, that she had recorded a total of fifteen new demos and even some of her old songs kept off the first album. In the end, however, AURORA opted for include only seven of the songs performed live on Infections Of A Different Kind – Step 1, adding a brand new song that gives the title to the release.\n\nBetween April and August 2018, the singer released two singles, Queendom and Forgotten Love, which were to be included on her second studio album. Aksnes recorded the album during her stay in France in January of that year, and the production included the producers Askjell Solstrand, Roy Kerr and Tim Bran, with Aksnes herself also involved in this aspect. Some of the new material was anticipated in live performances, including festivals like Lollapalooza and Coachella.\n\nWhile maintaining some of the themes and stories of the previous album, this production would mark the first time that Aksnes included political and sexual themes in her songs. Most of the new inspiration for these came from the interaction that she had with her fans during her first tour. The music video for Queendom saw its release in May 2018, and it included a message to her LGBTQ+ fans; such message was portrayed by Aksnes herself kissing one of her female dancers, during what was described as a \"big kissing party\" that shows that \"every type of love is accepted and embraced\" in the singer's \"Queendom\".\n\n\"Infections Of A Different Kind - Step I\" debuted at #7 on the Norwegian album chart, achieving platinum certification a while later. The album also debuted on the Netherlands album charts at position 191.\n\nThe second part of the project, A Different Kind Of Human – Step 2 was released in June 2020.\n\nIn September 2020 a Japanese version of the album was released, with an acoustic version of The River and the single Exist For Love as bonus tracks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Aurora/Infections+Of+A+Different+Kind+%E2%80%93+Step+1\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

        "bio_summary": "Alphabeat is a pop band from Silkeborg, Denmark signed to Polydor. The band were previously named Sodastar but this was changed to avoid confusion with a German band. \n\nTheir Danish debut single Fascination was a major hit in Denmark during the summer of 2007. A second single 10,000 Nights saw equal success, just like their eponymous debut album that went platinum in Denmark.\n\nTheir sound is mainly retro 80s melodic pop, taking inspiration amongst others from Deacon Blue and Prefab Sprout, with distinctive overlay of male and female harmonies. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Alphabeat\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",

Nanna said lead single \"Alligator\", called \"driving and percussion-heavy\" by Billboard, began like a \"dance song\", but that it is not entirely representative of the album's sound. She described the album as \"more poppy and brighter\" than the band's previous album, 2015's Beneath the Skin.\n\nCritical reception\nThe album received positive reviews from music critics. It holds a rating of 70 on Metacritic, indicating \"generally favorable\" reviews.\n\nCommercial performance\nFever Dream debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with 34,000 album-equivalent units, of which 30,000 were pure album sales. It is Of Monsters and Men's third US top 10 album. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Of+Monsters+and+Men/FEVER+DREAM\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

All of these influences led to her dreamy electro-pop vibe as MØ, which means \"maiden\" or \"virgin\" in Danish. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/M%C3%98\">Read more on Last.fm</a>",
